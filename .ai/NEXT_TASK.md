# Next Task: NW Pre-Submission Final Steps (2026-02-24)

## Status: Professor review fixes applied — near-ready for submission

## This Session (Session V) — Completed
1. **NW expert panel figure/table review** — 5 MUST FIX + 6 SHOULD FIX identified
2. **Terminology cleanup** — "A1" → "No ceiling", "Group A/B/C" → descriptive names (all 5 submission files)
3. **Table 3 → Fig. 4 forest plot** — promoted gen_fig3_crossmodel.py from SI to main text, added model parameter sizes
4. **Flood Fig. 3 promoted** to main text (was SI)
5. **Fig. 2 regenerated** with "No ceiling" labels
6. **10 professor review fixes applied**:
   - MF-1: Stripped changelog blocks from all submission files
   - MF-2: HumanCentric memory disclosed in R4 with equivalence proof
   - MF-3: Abstract "demand ratio" and "coupling" defined inline
   - MF-4: Dropped orphan "EHE" acronym from Methods LLM section
   - MF-5: BRI↔IBR cross-references added to both table footnotes
   - MF-6: Table 2 footnote clarifies IBR non-significant for Gemma-3 4B
   - MF-7: R4 opens with governed condition disclosure
   - MF-8: Prior-appropriation defined on first use in Results
   - MF-9: "no-ceiling" capitalization standardized
   - MF-10: Fig. 1/2/3 citations added to Introduction/Results
7. **Minor fixes**: Ministral→"Mistral AI" parenthetical, "code-level ceiling" disambiguated
8. **Word docs recompiled** (NatureWater_MainText_v14.docx + SI)

## Current Figure/Table Layout (4 figs + 2 tables)
- **Fig. 1**: Framework architecture (simulation loop with governance module)
- **Fig. 2**: Irrigation 4-panel (Mead elevation, demand ratio, action distribution, diversity-coupling scatter)
- **Fig. 3**: Flood cumulative adaptation (3 panels: PMT / Ungoverned / Governed)
- **Fig. 4**: Cross-model forest plot (6 models, paired dot + delta with 95% CI)
- **Table 1**: Irrigation 4-condition (Governed / Ungoverned / No Ceiling / FQL)
- **Table 2**: Flood 3-condition (Governed / PMT / Ungoverned)

## Remaining NW Tasks (Priority Order)
1. **Word count check** — may have grown with new definitions; verify ≤ 4,000
2. **Cover letter** — draft with water-governance emphasis
3. **Reference count** — verify against NW Analysis limit (30-50)
4. **Consider Gemma-3 12B irrigation** — would strengthen from 1-model to 2-model

## Deferred
- Citation format (Author, Year) → numbered superscripts
- Temperature sensitivity experiment
- Inter-rater reliability for cognitive frame taxonomy

## Paper 3 (MA Flood) — PAUSED
- Institutional C&V Phase B pilot pending (see previous NEXT_TASK for details)
