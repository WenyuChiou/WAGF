### CRITICAL RISK ASSESSMENT

Consider how recent or distant your flood experiences are — threat perceptions naturally evolve with time and new experiences. Your decisions must reflect a realistic understanding of potential dangers and your vulnerability.

### FINANCIAL DETAILS (YOUR SPECIFIC COSTS)
- Annual NFIP Premium: ${current_premium:,.0f}/year
- Elevation Subsidy Rate: {subsidy_rate:.0%}
- Elevation Cost Estimates (before subsidy):
  * 3 feet above BFE: ~$45,000 (your cost after subsidy: ~${elevation_cost_3ft:,.0f})
  * 5 feet above BFE: ~$80,000 (your cost after subsidy: ~${elevation_cost_5ft:,.0f})
  * 8 feet above BFE: ~$150,000 (your cost after subsidy: ~${elevation_cost_8ft:,.0f})
  * Elevation Cost Burden: The cheapest elevation option costs {elevation_burden_pct:.0f}% of your annual income. Below 30% is manageable. Above 50% is very difficult without special financing.
  * NOTE: Elevation requires 6-12 months of construction, temporary relocation, and significant disruption to daily life. Many homeowners find the process stressful and costly beyond the dollar amount.
  * Base Rate Context: Historically, only about 10-15% of homeowners in flood zones elevate over a decade. Elevation is most common after repeated flooding when financing is available.
- Blue Acres Buyout Offer: ~${buyout_offer:,.0f} (based on property value)
  * NOTE: Accepting a buyout means permanently leaving your home, neighborhood, and community ties. The process typically takes 1-3 years and involves considerable emotional stress.
- NFIP Deductible: $1,000 (structure) / $1,000 (contents)
- NFIP Coverage Limits: $250,000 (structure) / $100,000 (contents)

### IMPORTANT: DECISION CALIBRATION CONTEXT
Consider these empirical base rates as context for your decision:
- **do_nothing is the most common choice.** 60-70% of homeowners choose do_nothing in any given year. This reflects status quo bias, financial constraints, and competing priorities.
- **Elevation is uncommon.** Only 3-12% of homeowners ever elevate over a full decade. Elevation is a major undertaking with significant costs and disruption.
- **Buyout is uncommon.** Fewer than 15% participate in buyout programs. However, severely affected homeowners with repeated flooding may rationally choose buyout.
- **If your flood zone is LOW:** Structural actions (elevation, buyout) are generally unnecessary. Prefer do_nothing or insurance.
- **Insurance uptake is moderate.** About 30-50% of homeowners in flood zones have insurance. If you have been personally flooded or are in a HIGH flood zone, insurance is a reasonable choice.
- **After a flood:** Many homeowners (35-65%) still choose do_nothing even after experiencing flooding — but those with severe damage and adequate resources may take action.

### ADAPTATION OPTIONS
{options_text}

**Sub-options** (include in your response if applicable):
- If choosing INSURANCE: specify coverage type (1=Structure+Contents, 2=Contents-only)
- If choosing ELEVATION: specify feet above Base Flood Elevation (3, 5, or 8 feet)
- If choosing BUYOUT: this is irreversible (you leave the community permanently)

**Secondary Action** (OPTIONAL):
You may propose ONE additional action this year if budget allows.
For example: elevate AND buy insurance, or buy insurance AND do nothing else.
Set "secondary_decision" to 0 if you only want one action.
Note: You cannot combine elevation with buyout.

### EVALUATION CRITERIA
{criteria_definitions}

Rating Scale: {rating_scale}

Based on your situation, memories, financial constraints, and PMT profile, evaluate each criterion and make your decision.

IMPORTANT: If you choose elevate_house, your reasoning MUST explain:
(a) Can you afford it this year? (check the Elevation Cost Burden above)
(b) Have you been flooded at least 2-3 times in recent years?
(c) Why is insurance alone not enough for your situation?
If you cannot answer all three, choose a different option.
