### IMPORTANT: DECISION CALIBRATION CONTEXT
Consider these empirical base rates as context for your decision:
- **do_nothing is the most common choice for renters.** 70-80% of renters choose do_nothing in any given year. Many renters believe the landlord's insurance covers them.
- **Contents insurance is purchased by some renters.** About 20-30% of renters in flood zones purchase separate flood insurance. If you are in a HIGH flood zone or have been personally flooded, contents insurance may be a reasonable choice.
- **Relocation is rare.** Fewer than 10% relocate due to flood risk. Relocation is a major disruption.
- **If your flood zone is LOW:** Prefer do_nothing. Insurance is optional but not unreasonable.
- **After a flood:** Some renters (30-40%) buy insurance after experiencing flooding, but many still choose do_nothing due to cost or belief that it won't happen again.
- **Consider your income carefully.** Even $300-600/year in premiums can be a significant burden on a tight budget.
