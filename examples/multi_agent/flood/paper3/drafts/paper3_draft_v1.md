# LLM-Governed Multi-Agent Simulation of Household Flood Adaptation: Institutional Inertia, Memory Decay, and Social Diffusion in the Passaic River Basin

**Draft v1 — 2026-02-20**

## Abstract

Household flood adaptation is shaped by heterogeneous risk perceptions, institutional constraints, and social information exchange — processes that are difficult to represent endogenously in traditional rule-based agent-based models (ABMs). To address this challenge, we developed a large language model (LLM)-governed ABM that simulates 400 households making flood adaptation decisions over 13 years in the Passaic River Basin, New Jersey. The model employs a three-tier governance architecture — government subsidy, insurance pricing, and household decision-making — grounded in Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), where institutional feasibility constraints enforce domain-theoretic coherence on LLM-generated decisions. We validated the model using a three-level framework assessing micro-level action coherence, macro-level empirical plausibility, and cognitive consistency (mean Empirical Plausibility Index = 0.689 +/- 0.144 across three seeds). Our results reveal three key findings. First, flood memory is the dominant driver of adaptive behavior (eta^2 = 0.74), with risk perception decaying 5.8 times faster for marginalized households (half-life 13.2 years) than for non-marginalized households (77.0 years). Second, the insurance agent maintains unchanged Community Rating System discounts for 13 years despite recurring flood losses, producing institutional path dependence that perpetuates affordability barriers disproportionately constraining marginalized households (odds ratio = 1.38); whether this trajectory reflects plausible institutional conservatism or model reasoning limitations is discussed. Third, gossip is the most frequently cited social information channel (55.8%) but associates with lower protective action (relative risk = 0.75), while spatial clustering of insurance adoption increases over time (Moran's I slope = +0.005/yr), suggesting a gradual transition from inaction reinforcement to adaptation diffusion. These findings demonstrate that LLM-governed ABMs with institutional feasibility constraints can produce structurally plausible adaptation dynamics — including protection inequality and institutional path dependence — in coupled human-natural systems.

## 1. Introduction

Flood losses have been increasing globally over the past several decades, driven by the interaction between changing hydroclimate conditions and expanding urban development in flood-prone areas (IPCC, 2022; Wing et al., 2022). In the United States alone, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has paid over $70 billion in claims since its inception, with repetitive-loss properties accounting for a disproportionate share of total payouts (FEMA, 2020). Household-level adaptation — including flood insurance purchase, structural elevation, and voluntary buyout — represents a critical first line of defense against flood losses. However, adaptation decision-making processes are deeply heterogeneous, shaped by income, housing tenure, risk perception, prior flood experience, and access to institutional support (Grothmann & Reusswig, 2006; Bubeck et al., 2012). Marginalized communities face compounding barriers to adaptation: affordability constraints limit access to structural measures, information asymmetries reduce awareness of available programs, and historical distrust of government institutions dampens participation in voluntary programs (Rufat et al., 2015; Masozera et al., 2007). Understanding how these heterogeneous human behaviors interact with institutional feedback mechanisms to produce aggregate adaptation outcomes is a grand challenge for flood risk management.

Agent-based modeling (ABM), a bottom-up modeling approach known for its capability of describing emergent and heterogeneous agents' behaviors, has been widely applied to study flood adaptation decision-making processes (e.g., Haer et al., 2017; de Ruig et al., 2022; Dubbelboer et al., 2017; Aerts et al., 2018). The ABM framework identifies individual households as autonomous agents whose adaptive behaviors are governed by behavioral rules, and the model aggregates these bottom-up decisions to produce emergent system-level patterns. However, one major challenge of applying the ABM approach to flood adaptation is the specification of decision rules. Traditional rule-based ABMs require the modeler to define ex ante all possible behavioral pathways, typically through threshold-based decision trees or probabilistic choice models (An et al., 2021). While such approaches can reproduce aggregate patterns when carefully calibrated, they cannot represent novel reasoning, contextual judgment, or the influence of narrative memory on risk perception — processes that are central to how households actually make adaptation decisions (Grothmann & Reusswig, 2006). Furthermore, rule-based models have limited capacity for modeling endogenous institutional feedback: the co-evolution (i.e., bidirectional interactions) between government policy responses, insurance market adjustments, and household adaptive behaviors typically requires hard-coding institutional decision rules rather than allowing them to emerge from the simulation.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer a potential pathway to address these limitations. LLMs can serve as decision engines that generate natural language reasoning, maintain persona-specific memory, and differentiate behavioral responses across heterogeneous agent profiles (Park et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2024). Several studies have demonstrated that LLM-based agents can produce plausible social behaviors in stylized settings (e.g., Park et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024). However, applying LLMs to domain-specific decision-making in coupled natural-human systems (CNHS) introduces significant challenges: small-capacity models are prone to generating physically implausible or domain-inconsistent outputs (Huang et al., 2025), producing decisions that may be linguistically coherent but violate real-world feasibility constraints. We believe this challenge can be addressed, at least partially, by institutional constraint frameworks that enforce domain-theoretic bounds on LLM-generated decisions — analogous to how real-world institutions (e.g., building codes, insurance eligibility requirements, subsidy programs) shape the feasible set of household adaptation actions. We developed the Water Agent Governance Framework (WAGF), which uses Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; Rogers, 1983) to define construct-action coherence rules that validate every LLM-generated decision against the agent's threat perception, coping perception, and demographic constraints.

To address these research gaps, the objectives of this paper are (1) to develop and validate a multi-agent LLM-governed ABM of household flood adaptation in the Passaic River Basin (PRB), New Jersey, with 400 agents simulated over 13 years under a three-tier governance architecture (government, insurance, households); (2) to investigate how flood memory, institutional feedback, and social information channels interact to produce heterogeneous adaptive behaviors and protection inequality; and (3) to demonstrate that institutional feasibility constraints can scaffold credible CNHS simulations using small open-source language models (4 billion parameters). Specifically, we address three research questions:

- **RQ1**: How does flood memory affect within-group adaptation divergence between flooded and never-flooded households?
- **RQ2**: How does institutional feedback (government subsidy and insurance pricing) affect protection inequality between marginalized and non-marginalized households?
- **RQ3**: Which social information channels (gossip, social media, news media) accelerate the spatial diffusion of protective adaptation?

We validated the model using a three-level framework assessing micro-level action coherence (L1), macro-level empirical plausibility against eight independently sourced benchmarks (L2), and cognitive consistency through pre-experiment persona probing (L3). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce the study area in Section 2. The model architecture, agent initialization, governance rules, and validation framework are presented in Section 3. We show the results of the three research questions and cross-seed robustness analysis in Section 4. The implications, limitations, and future work are discussed in Section 5, followed by the conclusions in Section 6.

## 2. Study Area

The Passaic River Basin (PRB) is located in northern New Jersey and drains approximately 2,400 km^2 across portions of 10 counties. The PRB is one of the most flood-prone urban watersheds in the northeastern United States, with a history of repetitive flood losses dating back to the early 20th century (USACE, 2014). Major flood events in the simulation period include Hurricane Irene (2011), Hurricane Sandy (2012), and multiple nor'easters that produced significant riverine and pluvial flooding. The basin's topography — a combination of steep uplands and low-lying floodplains — creates rapid hydrologic response that concentrates flood risk in densely populated downstream communities.

The PRB exhibits substantial demographic heterogeneity. Household incomes range from less than $25,000 to more than $75,000, with significant populations of marginalized households characterized by low income, high housing cost burden, or limited transportation access. NFIP participation rates vary widely across communities, and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) has operated the Blue Acres buyout program since 1995, acquiring repetitive-loss properties in flood-prone areas (NJDEP, 2020). This combination of recurring flood hazard, demographic diversity, and active institutional programs makes the PRB a well-suited case study for investigating the co-evolution of household adaptive behaviors and institutional responses.

We used 13 years of spatially distributed flood depth raster grids (2011-2023) derived from PRB hydrologic records to assign agent-specific flood exposure at each time step. Each agent's location determines its flood depth in any given year, enabling heterogeneous hazard experience across the agent population.

## 3. Methods

### 3.1 WAGF Architecture

We developed the Water Agent Governance Framework (WAGF), a three-tier sequential decision framework that couples institutional and household decision-making processes within each annual simulation cycle. The three tiers — government, insurance, and households — execute sequentially, such that each tier's decisions propagate as updated institutional parameters to the subsequent tier.

In Tier 1, the government agent (representing NJDEP) observes community-level flood damage, cumulative elevation rates, and the proportion of marginalized households in the agent population. Based on these inputs, the government agent selects one of three actions: increase, maintain, or decrease the subsidy rate by 5 percentage points per year. In Tier 2, the insurance agent (representing FEMA's Community Rating System) observes the loss ratio, number of insured households, and current CRS class, and selects among adjusting the CRS discount, modifying the premium rate, or maintaining current rates. In Tier 3, the 400 household agents receive the updated subsidy rate, CRS discount, and premium rate, and make individual adaptation decisions through language model-generated reasoning.

All three tiers use Gemma 3 4B (Google, 2024), a locally deployed open-source language model with 4 billion parameters. We selected this model to represent a lower bound on language model reasoning capacity, demonstrating that credible CNHS simulations are achievable without reliance on proprietary or computationally expensive models. Each agent produces a structured decision record containing the chosen action, self-assessed threat perception, coping perception, and natural language reasoning that explains the decision rationale. Institutional feasibility constraints (Section 3.4) enforce domain-theoretic coherence on all agent-generated decisions before they are accepted into the simulation state.

### 3.2 Agent Initialization

We initialized 400 household agents in a 2x2 factorial design crossing marginalization status (MG/NMG) with housing tenure (owner/renter), yielding 100 agents per cell. Marginalization status was defined using a composite criterion: a household is classified as marginalized if its annual income is below $50,000, its housing cost burden exceeds 30% of income, or it lacks vehicle access — consistent with social vulnerability indices used in environmental justice research (Rufat et al., 2015). Demographic attributes (income, household size, education, employment) were sampled from distributions derived from a New Jersey household survey (n = 755).

Flood zone assignment reflects the empirical pattern that marginalized communities are disproportionately located in flood-prone areas (Wing et al., 2022): MG agents are assigned 70% to Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) and 30% to lower-risk zones, while NMG agents are assigned 50/50. Replacement cost values (RCVs) for owner-occupied homes follow lognormal distributions with medians of $280,000 (MG) and $400,000 (NMG), with a shape parameter of 0.3. Renter agents are assigned contents-only values scaled by income. Agents are spatially placed within PRB census tracts using population-weighted random assignment.

Each agent is initialized with a set of six memory categories: prior flood experience, insurance history, social context (neighborhood composition), government trust level, place attachment, and flood zone awareness. These memories are provided in the agent's decision context at the start of simulation and are updated annually as the agent accumulates flood exposure, receives institutional feedback, and observes neighbor actions.

### 3.3 Decision Skills

Household agents select from tenure-specific action sets at each annual time step. Owner-occupied households choose among five actions: buy_insurance (NFIP flood insurance), elevate_house (structural elevation above base flood elevation), buyout_program (voluntary acquisition through Blue Acres), retrofit (intermediate flood-proofing), and do_nothing. Renter households choose among three actions: buy_contents_insurance, relocate, and do_nothing. Each decision produces a structured record containing the chosen action, self-assessed threat perception (VL/L/M/H/VH), coping perception (VL/L/M/H/VH), and natural language reasoning that explains the agent's decision rationale.

We employed a Default-Override decision structure informed by behavioral decision theory (Samuelson & Zeckhauser, 1988). Inaction (do_nothing) is declared as the explicit default; to override this default, an agent must pass a three-gate filter: (1) Is the flood risk urgent enough to act? (2) Is the adaptation financially affordable? (3) Is the disruption worth the benefit? This structure operationalizes the status quo bias and present bias documented in household flood adaptation research (Gallagher, 2014; O'Donoghue & Rabin, 1999). For elevation and buyout specifically, the agent's decision context describes concrete PRB-specific feasibility barriers — local permitting requirements, specialized contractor scarcity (fewer than 12 firms in northern New Jersey), federal grant competition (2-5 year timelines), and temporary relocation costs — rather than population-level adoption statistics, because individual agents cannot observe global frequencies in a decentralized system.

### 3.4 Governance Rules

The institutional feasibility constraint framework operationalizes Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; Rogers, 1983) as a construct-action coherence matrix. Each cell in the threat perception (TP) by coping perception (CP) matrix specifies the set of adaptive actions that are theoretically consistent with that appraisal state. For example, agents reporting high threat perception and high coping perception are permitted to pursue structural measures (elevation, buyout, insurance), while agents with low threat perception are restricted to do_nothing or optional insurance — reflecting the PMT prediction that protective motivation requires both perceived vulnerability and perceived efficacy (Grothmann & Reusswig, 2006).

Beyond PMT coherence, we implemented 14 institutional feasibility constraints that enforce real-world regulatory and financial barriers. The affordability validator blocks actions whose estimated cost exceeds the agent's financial capacity, computed from income, existing debt, and available subsidy. Elevation gates require a combination of income threshold, prior flood experience, and flood zone justification — mirroring the multi-criteria eligibility screening of federal Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) applications. Zone-based restrictions prevent agents outside SFHAs from pursuing flood-zone-specific programs. Repetitive loss requirements gate buyout eligibility on documented flood history, consistent with FEMA's Severe Repetitive Loss program criteria.

When a proposed action is rejected by any feasibility constraint, the agent is given up to three attempts to propose a feasible alternative. If all attempts are rejected, the agent defaults to do_nothing — an outcome we term *involuntary non-adaptation*. Because affordability constraints bind more frequently for low-income agents, this mechanism produces differential protection outcomes between MG and NMG households as a structural consequence of income-dependent feasibility thresholds, rather than through explicitly programmed disparate treatment. The governance rejection and its reason are stored in the agent's memory, influencing subsequent year decision-making processes.

### 3.5 Social Information Channels

We modeled three social information channels that are provided to each household agent's decision context at the beginning of every annual decision cycle. First, gossip represents local peer information: each agent receives a summary of the adaptive actions taken by its five spatially nearest neighbors in the previous year, constructed from the k-nearest-neighbor graph (k = 5) over agent locations. Second, social media provides community-wide aggregate statistics, including the overall proportion of agents who purchased insurance, elevated, or relocated in the previous year. Third, news media delivers flood event reporting with PRB-specific context when a flood event occurs in the simulation, including damage estimates and affected areas.

All three channels are available to every agent in every year; agents do not selectively subscribe to channels. This design reflects the observation that household flood information environments are multifaceted — residents simultaneously receive information from neighbors, online platforms, and media coverage — and the relative influence of each channel is an empirical question rather than an a priori model specification (Bubeck et al., 2012). In Year 1, when no prior neighbor actions exist, the gossip channel delivers an inaction baseline to prevent initialization artifacts.

We tracked channel citation through content analysis of the natural language reasoning component of each agent's decision record. An agent is classified as citing a channel if its reasoning text references channel-specific content (e.g., neighbor actions for gossip; flood reporting for news media). This allows post-hoc analysis of which information sources agents reference when justifying their adaptive decisions.

### 3.6 Calibration and Validation

Full methodological detail is provided in `section_3_6_cv_methods.md`. In summary, we adopt a three-level validation framework extending Pattern-Oriented Modeling (Grimm et al., 2005):

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Validation Summary

We ran the simulation with three random seeds (42, 43, 44), each producing 5,200 agent-year decisions (400 agents x 13 years) for a total of 15,600 decisions across seeds. Table 1 summarizes the validation results across all three levels.

| Level | Metric | Threshold | Seed 42 | Cross-Seed Mean +/- SD |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------|----------------------|
| L1 | CACR | >= 0.80 | 0.852 | PASS (all seeds) |
| L1 | R_H | <= 0.10 | 0.000 | PASS (all seeds) |
| L1 | EBE (normalized) | (0.10, 0.90) | 0.531 | PASS (all seeds) |
| L2 | EPI | >= 0.60 | 0.890 | 0.689 +/- 0.144 |
| L3 | ICC(2,1) | >= 0.60 | 0.964 | — (pre-experiment) |
| L3 | eta^2 | >= 0.25 | 0.33 | — (pre-experiment) |
| L3 | Directional sensitivity | >= 75% | 75% | — (pre-experiment) |

*Table 1: Three-level validation summary. L3 metrics were computed from pre-experiment ICC probing and are seed-independent.*

**L1 Micro-Level Coherence.** All three seeds pass L1 requirements. On the reference seed (seed 42), we obtained CACR = 0.852 (threshold >= 0.80), indicating that 85.2% of individual decision-making processes are consistent with Protection Motivation Theory given each agent's threat perception and coping perception. The hallucination rate R_H = 0.000 — we observed zero physically impossible actions across 5,200 decisions. The Effective Behavioral Entropy EBE = 0.531 (normalized) falls within the acceptable range (0.10-0.90), confirming structured diversity: agents distribute their adaptive behaviors across six distinct actions rather than collapsing to a single dominant choice or producing uniformly random outputs.

**L2 Macro-Level Plausibility.** The mean EPI across three seeds is 0.689 +/- 0.144 (threshold >= 0.60). On seed 42, EPI = 0.890 with 7 of 8 benchmarks passing. The sole failure is B8 (insurance lapse rate = 0.355, target 0.15-0.30), suggesting that agents lapse insurance at slightly higher rates than empirical observations. This might partially be explained by the tendency of agents to weight recent flood experience disproportionately over longer-term insurance commitment — a form of temporal discounting consistent with observed insurance lapse behavior (Gallagher, 2014). Across seeds, per-seed EPI values are 0.890, 0.560, and 0.615, reflecting seed-dependent variation in flood exposure sequences. Table 2 provides the full benchmark breakdown.

| Benchmark | Description | Target Range | Seed 42 | Cross-Seed Mean +/- SD |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|----------------------|
| B1 | Insurance rate (SFHA) | 0.30-0.60 | 0.507 | 0.645 +/- 0.098 |
| B2 | Insurance rate (all) | 0.15-0.55 | 0.320 | 0.419 +/- 0.071 |
| B3 | Elevation rate | 0.10-0.35 | 0.285 | 0.248 +/- 0.031 |
| B4 | Buyout rate | 0.05-0.25 | 0.088 | 0.093 +/- 0.013 |
| B5 | Post-flood inaction | 0.35-0.65 | 0.508 | 0.390 +/- 0.085 |
| B6 | MG adaptation gap | 0.05-0.30 | 0.065 | 0.055 +/- 0.011 |
| B7 | Renter uninsured | 0.15-0.40 | 0.184 | 0.180 +/- 0.004 |
| **B8** | **Insurance lapse** | **0.15-0.30** | **0.355** | **0.344 +/- 0.010** |

*Table 2: L2 empirical benchmark results. Bold indicates values outside the target range.*

**L3 Cognitive Consistency.** Pre-experiment ICC probing yielded ICC(2,1) = 0.964 across 6 archetypes, indicating that 96.4% of decision variance derives from between-persona differences rather than within-persona noise. We observed an effect size of eta^2 = 0.33 (moderate sensitivity to flood depth) and directional sensitivity of 75% (i.e., agents increase protective action following severe floods at the minimum acceptable threshold).

**LLM Reasoning vs. Institutional Constraint Contribution.** To quantify the relative contribution of LLM reasoning versus institutional constraints to behavioral coherence, we computed CACR separately for pre-governance proposals (CACR_raw) and post-governance accepted decisions (CACR_final) using governance audit records. Across three seeds, CACR_raw = 0.850 +/- 0.020 and CACR_final = 0.862 +/- 0.037, yielding a governance uplift of only +0.012. This indicates that the LLM itself produces PMT-coherent decisions 85% of the time; the institutional feasibility constraints serve as a safety net for the remaining cases rather than as the primary driver of behavioral coherence. The retry rate (proportion of decisions requiring re-proposal after governance rejection) averages 12.0% across seeds, with seed 42 (pre-bugfix) exhibiting a higher rate (17.3%) than seeds 43-44 (9.0-9.8%).

**Institutional Constraint Impact.** The institutional feasibility constraints intervened in 1,292 of 5,200 decisions (24.8%) on seed 42, where an "intervention" denotes any instance in which a constraint was triggered (e.g., affordability check, eligibility requirement, or flood zone restriction). Of these interventions, 686 resulted in the agent being unable to propose a feasible alternative within the allowed attempts (13.2% constrained non-adaptation rate), while the remainder were resolved through successful proposal revision (301) or format correction (103). The affordability constraint was the most frequently triggered rule, accounting for 641 of 1,292 interventions (49.6%); of the 686 constrained outcomes, 544 (79.3%) were attributable to affordability barriers. We note that seed 42 exhibits a higher constrained non-adaptation rate (13.2%) than the cross-seed mean (7.7% +/- 3.9%). This is because seed 42 experienced more severe early flood exposure (70.2% of agents flooded in Year 1), which prompted more agents to attempt expensive structural adaptations (e.g., elevation, buyout) that exceeded their financial capacity.

### 4.2 RQ1: Flood Memory and Adaptation Divergence

**How does flood memory affect within-group adaptation divergence?**

We found that flood exposure is the dominant driver of risk perception and heterogeneous adaptive behaviors (Figure 2). Of the 400 agents, 281 (70.2%) experienced at least one flood during the 13-year simulation (driven by agent-specific PRB flood depth rasters), while 119 (29.8%) were never flooded.

**Flood exposure drives risk perception.** A Kruskal-Wallis test across 8 flood-by-demographic cells (flooded/never x 4 demographic groups) yields H = 3836.0, p < 0.001, with eta^2 = 0.74, indicating that flood exposure explains 74% of the variance in threat perception scores. Flooded agents maintain elevated threat perception (mean = 2.74 on a 1-5 scale) while never-flooded agents remain at baseline (mean = 1.01). Mann-Whitney U tests confirm this separation within every demographic cell (all p < 0.001, rank-biserial r = -0.98).

**Risk perception decays asymmetrically across demographic groups.** We fitted an exponential decay model TP(t) = TP_0 * exp(-lambda * t) to post-flood threat perception trajectories and obtained a population-level half-life of 12.9 years (lambda = 0.054, R^2 = 0.575). However, the moderate aggregate fit masks substantial demographic heterogeneity: MG agents exhibit a half-life of 13.2 years (lambda = 0.053, R^2 = 0.592), while NMG agents show a half-life of 77.0 years (lambda = 0.009, R^2 = 0.750) — a 5.8x difference in decay rate (Figure S1). This asymmetry is consistent with empirical findings that lower-income households exhibit faster attenuation of flood risk perception, possibly due to competing livelihood stressors and limited cognitive bandwidth for sustained hazard awareness (Gallagher, 2014; Shah et al., 2012). However, because these decay trajectories emerge from agent demographic profiles rather than from a mechanistic cognitive model, we cannot rule out the possibility that model-inherent biases contribute to the observed demographic gradient. We return to this interpretive limitation in Section 5.

**Flooded agents show greater behavioral diversity.** We computed the Shannon entropy of decision distributions for each demographic-by-flood-exposure cell. The entropy is consistently higher for flooded agents than for never-flooded agents across all four demographic cells. The mean entropy difference (flooded minus never) ranges from +0.96 bits (NMG-O) to +1.22 bits (MG-O). Notably, never-flooded MG renters show zero entropy across all 13 years — every agent chooses do_nothing every year — while flooded MG renters reach entropy values of 0.90-1.10 bits, distributing their decision-making processes across insurance and relocation.

**Decision persistence differs sharply.** Year-over-year decision persistence (i.e., choosing the same adaptive action as the previous year) is 76.8% for flooded agents versus 93.6% for never-flooded agents. Among flooded agents, insurance shows the highest persistence (buy_contents_insurance: 87% self-transition; buy_insurance: 72%), while elevation is the least persistent (34% self-transition), with 39% of post-elevation decisions followed by insurance and 17% by do_nothing. This pattern suggests that agents treat elevation as a one-time structural adaptation followed by complementary protection measures.

**Chi-squared tests confirm distributional divergence.** We tested whether the decision distributions differ significantly between flooded and never-flooded agents using chi-squared tests for each demographic cell. All four cells show significant divergence (all chi^2 > 180, all p < 0.001). Effect sizes are largest for the NMG cells (Cramer's V = 0.55 for both NMG-O and NMG-R), reflecting greater behavioral repertoire diversity among non-marginalized agents with flood experience.

### 4.3 RQ2: Institutional Feedback and Protection Inequality

**How does institutional feedback affect protection inequality between marginalized and non-marginalized households?**

We found that the three-tier governance architecture produces institutional dynamics that both mitigate and perpetuate protection inequality — a co-evolution mechanism between institutional decision-making processes and household adaptive behaviors.

**Government responds but insurance does not.** The government agent (NJDEP) increased the subsidy rate every year, from 55% in Year 1 to 100% by Year 13 — a monotonic pro-adaptation trajectory that was not prescribed by the simulation design (Figure 3a). The government agent's action space includes increase, maintain, and decrease options; nevertheless, the model agent consistently selected "increase," citing the persistently low number of elevated homes and the high proportion of MG households in its reasoning. This emergent institutional behavior might partially be explained by bureaucratic momentum — a well-documented tendency in public agencies where persistent adaptation deficits justify continued program expansion (Berke & Campanella, 2006). Whether this trajectory represents a plausible policy response or an artifact of model reasoning limitations is discussed in Section 5. In contrast, the insurance agent (FEMA CRS) chose "maintain" in all 13 years: the Community Rating System (CRS) discount remained at 0% and the premium rate held at 0.8% for 12 years before a single increase to 2.0% in Year 13. Despite loss ratios spiking to 79.3 after major flood years, the insurance agent's reasoning emphasized preserving "exceptional performance" — an institutional path dependence where conservative framing prevents policy adjustment.

**The adaptation gap narrows but persists.** We observed that MG agents consistently show lower protective action rates than NMG agents across all adaptation types (Figure 3c). For insurance, the mean annual gap is 10.2 percentage points (MG: 20.5%, NMG: 30.7%; Mann-Whitney U = 15.0, p < 0.001). For elevation, the gap is smaller but significant (MG: 3.4%, NMG: 5.5%; paired t = -4.49, p < 0.001). We fitted a linear regression on the composite "any protective action" gap and found a narrowing trend (slope = -0.0075/yr, R^2 = 0.565, p = 0.003), declining from a 16.0 percentage point gap in Year 1 to 4.1 points in Year 13. The elevation gap narrows significantly (slope = -0.003/yr, p = 0.002), while the insurance gap narrows non-significantly (slope = -0.003/yr, p = 0.114). Nevertheless, the persistent gap at Year 13 indicates that the co-evolution between institutional responses and household decision-making processes does not fully resolve the structural inequality within the simulation period.

**Affordability is the dominant barrier.** Governance rejections fall disproportionately on MG agents (Figure 3b). Of 686 total rejections on seed 42, affordability accounts for 544 (79.3%). MG agents face a 12.7% affordability rejection rate versus 8.2% for NMG agents. A chi-squared test confirms significantly higher rejection rates for MG agents (chi^2 = 15.16, p < 0.001, odds ratio = 1.38). The affordability ratio (MG/NMG rejection rate) fluctuates between 1.1x and 2.3x across years, spiking in years when MG agents attempt more expensive adaptations. This mechanism creates what we term *involuntary non-adaptation*: MG agents who intend to elevate or participate in buyout programs are blocked by institutional feasibility constraints that enforce real-world financial barriers, effectively redirecting them to do_nothing as a default outcome. This finding is consistent with the environmental justice literature documenting structural barriers to flood adaptation among lower-income communities (Rufat et al., 2015).

**Subsidy increases correlate with MG elevation.** Despite insurance stagnation, the government's subsidy increases show a significant positive correlation with MG elevation rates (r = +0.724, p = 0.005). This suggests that the subsidy pathway — the only institutional lever that moved — partially compensates for insurance inertia by reducing the financial barrier to structural adaptation for MG households. Consequently, the interaction between human adaptive behaviors and institutional responses appears to be mediated primarily through the subsidy channel rather than through the insurance market.

**The insurance feedback loop is disrupted.** We conducted cross-correlation analysis between loss ratios and insurance uptake and found no significant lagged relationship (r = +0.150, p = 0.642 at lag-1). The expected feedback chain — flood damage leading to loss ratio increase, triggering premium adjustment, and subsequently altering household adaptive behavior — fails at the institutional decision node: the insurance agent's consistent "maintain" choice prevents price signals from reaching households. This pattern is consistent with the institutional inertia documented in the NFIP literature (Gallagher, 2014; Kousky, 2017), though we cannot distinguish whether it reflects genuine institutional conservatism or a tendency of the 4B-parameter model to default to "maintain" when faced with complex policy trade-offs (see Section 5).

### 4.4 RQ3: Social Information Channel Citation and Spatial Patterns

**Which social information channels do agents reference when reasoning about adaptation?**

We investigated the role of three social information channels available to all agents each year: gossip (neighbor actions), social media (community aggregates), and news media (flood reporting). We analyzed their citation frequency in agent reasoning, their association with protective adaptive behaviors, and the resulting spatial patterns. We note that the memory consolidation pipeline was impaired in seed 42 (Section 5), so these results primarily reflect how agents reference channel content provided in their decision context rather than how agents learn from social information over time. The spatial clustering analysis (Moran's I) is less affected because it depends on spatially correlated flood exposure and observed neighbor actions rather than on consolidated memory.

**Gossip dominates but does not promote protection.** Gossip is cited in 55.8% of all agent-year decisions (averaged across years), far exceeding social media (0.8%) and news media (3.7%) (Figure 4b). However, agents citing gossip show a *lower* protective action rate (34.6%) than non-citers (46.3%), yielding a relative risk of 0.75. This counterintuitive finding might be explained by the information content of gossip: because the majority of neighbors choose do_nothing (60.2% overall), gossip primarily transmits inaction norms — a social norm effect (Bicchieri & Muldoon, 2011) that reinforces the status quo. Owner agents cite gossip more frequently (69.8%) than renters (41.8%), consistent with owners' greater neighborhood embeddedness and longer residential tenure.

**News media associates with lower protection but carries flood context.** News media, cited in only 3.7% of decisions, shows an even lower protective rate among citers (27.3%, RR = 0.68). However, news citation is concentrated among never-flooded agents who lack personal flood experience. Consequently, the channel's low protective association likely reflects the population it serves rather than its causal effect on decision-making processes.

**Social media is rare but weakly positive.** Social media is cited in only 0.8% of decisions (44 of 5,200), precluding robust statistical inference. Among citers, the protective rate is 43.2% (RR = 1.09 relative to non-citers), a non-significant difference given the small sample size.

**Spatial clustering of adaptive behaviors increases over time.** We computed Moran's I to quantify the spatial autocorrelation of cumulative adaptive actions (Figure S3). For insurance adoption, Moran's I rises from 0.033 (non-significant) in Year 1 to 0.117 (z = 5.13, p < 0.001) in Year 13, with a trend slope of +0.005/yr (r = 0.812). For any protective action, spatial autocorrelation is even stronger: Moran's I increases from 0.046 (z = 2.08) to 0.221 (z = 9.61). In contrast, elevation shows no significant spatial clustering until Year 9 (I = 0.060, z = 2.16), consistent with elevation being driven by individual flood experience rather than social contagion. The increasing spatial clustering of insurance suggests a diffusion process mediated by local information exchange (gossip), despite gossip's paradoxical association with lower individual-level protection: as more neighbors adopt insurance, gossip content shifts from inaction to protection, gradually shifting the channel's informational content from reinforcing inaction to promoting protective adaptation.

**Adoption timing varies by income and flood zone.** We analyzed the time-to-first-protective-action using Kaplan-Meier survival curves (Figure 4a). The median time is 1.0 year for renters versus 2.0 years for owners, reflecting the lower cost barrier of contents insurance. NMG agents adopt faster (mean 2.8 years) than MG agents (4.5 years). Agents in high flood zones show the highest adoption rate (78%) with a mean adoption time of 3.4 years, compared to only 9% adoption in low-risk zones. Among income brackets, households earning more than $75K adopt earliest (mean 2.4 years, 65% adoption rate), while those earning less than $25K adopt latest (mean 5.9 years, 26% adoption rate). These heterogeneous adoption patterns are consistent with empirical observations that flood adaptation is stratified by both socioeconomic status and hazard exposure (Bubeck et al., 2012).

**Behavioral entropy increases over time.** On seed 42, we computed the Shannon entropy of annual population-level action distributions and found that it rises from 1.54 bits (early: Years 1-3) to 1.67 bits (late: Years 10-13), a change of +0.13 bits (trend slope = +0.014 bits/year) (Figure S4). The cross-seed robustness analysis (Section 4.5), which computes entropy using a per-agent aggregation method, yields larger absolute changes (+0.185 to +0.235 bits) but the same qualitative finding: behavioral diversity increases rather than converges over time. This divergence contradicts the prediction that the social norm effect would homogenize adaptive behaviors, suggesting instead that agents develop increasingly heterogeneous behavioral portfolios as accumulated flood experience and institutional feedback differentiate their adaptation trajectories.

**First-movers rely less on gossip.** We classified agents by adoption timing and found a clear gradient in social information dependence. Agents who first adopt protective action in Years 1-3 ("first-movers," n = 146) cite gossip at 43.9%, compared to 52.3% for followers (Years 4+, n = 74) and 66.9% for never-adopters (n = 180). This gradient suggests that first-movers are driven by personal flood experience and internal risk perception, while non-adopters are more dependent on (inaction-biased) social information. Among spatially defined leaders (agents who adopt before their nearest neighbors), 133 out of 220 adopters (60.5%) led their local neighborhood, indicating that the majority of adaptive behavior originates from individual flood experience rather than through social imitation.

### 4.5 Cross-Seed Robustness

We tested the sensitivity of our findings to stochastic variation in model sampling and flood exposure sequences using three random seeds (42, 43, 44) (Figure 5).

**Validation metrics.** Per-seed EPI values are 0.890, 0.560, and 0.615 (mean = 0.689 +/- 0.144). We computed EPI per-seed and then averaged; individual benchmark pass/fail is determined per-seed, not from the cross-seed mean. Two benchmarks exhibit notable cross-seed variance: B1 (insurance in SFHA: mean 0.645 +/- 0.098) exceeds the upper target of 0.60 on the cross-seed mean, failing on seeds 43 and 44 where sustained government subsidy escalation (see Section 4.3) drives higher-than-expected insurance uptake in flood zones. B5 (post-flood inaction: mean 0.390 +/- 0.085) remains within range on average but shows high variance tied to the timing and severity of major flood events. Four benchmarks are stable across all seeds: B3 (elevation: 0.248 +/- 0.031), B4 (buyout: 0.093 +/- 0.013), B7 (renter uninsured: 0.180 +/- 0.004), and B8 (insurance lapse: 0.344 +/- 0.010). B8 fails across all seeds (mean 0.344, target 0.15-0.30), confirming this as a systematic model characteristic rather than a seed-specific artifact.

**Decision distribution stability.** We computed the coefficients of variation (CoV) across seeds for each metric, which range from 2.9% (renter uninsured rate) to 25.1% (post-flood inaction), with most metrics below 15%. The low CoV of structural metrics (elevation, buyout, renter outcomes) versus behavioral metrics (insurance, inaction) is consistent with the institutional feasibility constraints providing a stabilizing floor: affordability and eligibility requirements limit the range of possible adaptation outcomes regardless of stochastic variation in agent decision-making. This finding suggests that the institutional constraint architecture enhances the reproducibility of the coupled human-natural system simulation.

**Entropy divergence is robust.** All three seeds show entropy increasing from early to late periods: +0.185, +0.207, and +0.235 bits respectively (cross-seed mean: +0.209 +/- 0.025 bits). The consistent positive entropy trend confirms that behavioral diversification is a structural property of the model rather than a stochastic artifact, reinforcing the heterogeneous adaptive behaviors observed in Sections 4.2-4.4.

**L1 metrics are invariant.** CACR, R_H (domain-inconsistent action rate), and EBE show minimal cross-seed variation, indicating that micro-level behavioral coherence is maintained by the PMT-based institutional constraint architecture rather than being sensitive to seed-dependent model outputs. This stability represents a key advantage of the institutional constraint approach: even when aggregate benchmarks shift across seeds, the quality of individual agent decision-making processes remains consistently high.

## 5. Discussion

This study presents a multi-agent LLM-governed ABM of household flood adaptation in the Passaic River Basin, validated against empirical benchmarks at three levels. Our results reveal that flood memory is the dominant driver of heterogeneous adaptive behaviors (eta^2 = 0.74), but that risk perception decay is asymmetric across demographic groups — marginalized households lose risk awareness 5.8 times faster than non-marginalized households. The insurance agent's 13-year "maintain" trajectory produces institutional path dependence that perpetuates affordability barriers, while the government subsidy channel partially compensates through monotonic increases — though whether these institutional trajectories reflect plausible conservatism or model reasoning limitations requires further investigation. Social information channels exhibit a paradoxical pattern in which the most frequently cited channel (gossip) reinforces inaction norms, yet increasing spatial clustering of adaptive behaviors suggests a gradual transition from status quo reinforcement to protection diffusion. Together, these findings demonstrate that LLM-governed agents with institutional feasibility constraints can produce structurally plausible adaptation dynamics in coupled human-natural systems — though we emphasize that "structural plausibility" denotes consistency with empirical benchmarks and behavioral theory, not predictive accuracy or confirmed causal mechanisms.

Our approach differs from traditional rule-based flood ABMs (e.g., Haer et al., 2017; de Ruig et al., 2022) in a fundamental way: rather than specifying all behavioral pathways ex ante through decision trees or probabilistic choice models (An et al., 2021), household agents generate natural language reasoning that references personal flood history, evaluates financial tradeoffs, and adapts to changing institutional parameters. The institutional constraint framework addresses known limitations of language model-based agents — domain-inconsistent outputs, action bias, and base rate ignorance (Huang et al., 2025) — through feasibility constraints that are analogous to how real-world institutions shape the feasible set of household adaptive actions. The resulting EPI (0.689 +/- 0.144) is comparable to or exceeds validation performance reported in existing flood ABMs, most of which rely on subjective plausibility assessments rather than quantitative multi-benchmark evaluation (Grimm et al., 2005).

The findings carry several implications for flood risk management and water resources policy. First, the insurance agent's persistent conservative trajectory — whether it reflects plausible institutional conservatism or model reasoning limitations — highlights the sensitivity of adaptation outcomes to institutional update rules. If confirmed through counterfactual analysis with fixed-rule institutional agents, this result would suggest that automating CRS discount adjustments based on community loss experience might reduce adaptation inequality more effectively than expanding household subsidies alone. Second, the finding that affordability constraints account for 79.3% of governance rejections reinforces the environmental justice scholarship documenting structural barriers to flood adaptation among lower-income communities (Rufat et al., 2015). Third, the paradoxical role of gossip — widely cited but associated with lower protection — suggests that targeted information interventions may be less effective than reducing structural barriers to adaptation, because the informational environment is dominated by inaction norms until a sufficient proportion of neighbors adopt protective measures.

Several limitations should be noted. First, all results derive from a single language model (Gemma 3 4B), representing a lower bound on model reasoning capacity; results might differ with larger models, and the transferability of the calibrated decision context to other language models is untested. Second, the systematic failure of B8 (insurance lapse rate = 0.344, target 0.15-0.30) across all seeds might partially reflect a tendency of the small model to weight recent flood experience disproportionately over longer-term insurance commitment. Third, the government subsidy escalation to 100% and the insurance feedback loop disruption may represent model reasoning artifacts rather than plausible institutional trajectories; a counterfactual experiment with fixed-rule institutional agents is needed to distinguish genuine institutional dynamics from model limitations. Fourth, the memory consolidation pipeline produced undifferentiated year-end reflections for all agents in seed 42 (pre-bugfix), meaning that social learning through accumulated memory was impaired for that seed. Seeds 43 and 44 used the corrected pipeline, but the RQ3 social channel findings should be interpreted as channel citation patterns in agent reasoning rather than as evidence of genuine social learning or information diffusion. The spatial clustering results (Moran's I) are less affected by this limitation because they reflect spatially correlated flood exposure and observed neighbor actions rather than consolidated memory content. Fifth, the model assumes a static population with no births, deaths, or migration over 13 years; the interaction between demographic change and adaptive behavior remains unexplored. Sixth, the institutional feasibility constraints encode researcher assumptions about theoretically consistent adaptive behavior, which introduces a form of structural bias — the involuntary non-adaptation rate (79.3% affordability-driven) is contingent on the 5% premium-to-income affordability threshold, and different thresholds would yield different constrained non-adaptation rates. Finally, the spatial structure is simplified (census-tract-weighted random placement) relative to true address-level residential patterns.

Future work should address these limitations through several extensions. Multi-model comparison — repeating the simulation with larger language models (e.g., Gemma 12B, Llama 3 8B) — would quantify the influence of model reasoning capacity on emergent adaptive behaviors and help distinguish genuine behavioral dynamics from model-specific artifacts. Two-way coupled hazard-adaptation modeling, integrating WAGF with hydrodynamic models, would enable bidirectional feedback between human adaptive behaviors and evolving flood risk — effectively creating a computational sandbox (Hung & Yang, 2022) for testing coupled natural-human system hypotheses. Dynamic institutional rules that allow feasibility constraints to co-evolve with system-level outcomes would address the current limitation of fixed constraint thresholds. Extension to other water resources management challenges — including drought adaptation and coastal sea-level rise — would test the transferability of the WAGF framework beyond fluvial flood risk. Evaluation of model uncertainty at the system, agent, and parameter levels is suggested for future research, following the uncertainty quantification framework proposed by Hung and Yang (2022).

## 6. Conclusions

We developed and validated a multi-agent LLM-governed ABM of household flood adaptation in the Passaic River Basin, simulating 400 heterogeneous households over 13 years under a three-tier institutional governance architecture. Three principal findings emerge from this study. First, flood memory is the dominant driver of heterogeneous adaptive behaviors (eta^2 = 0.74), with risk perception decaying 5.8 times faster for marginalized households than for non-marginalized households — suggesting that socioeconomic vulnerability compounds risk perception vulnerability in coupled human-natural systems. Second, the insurance agent's 13-year conservative trajectory produces institutional path dependence that disproportionately constrains marginalized households through affordability barriers, while government subsidy expansion partially compensates — though further counterfactual analysis is needed to distinguish this from model reasoning limitations. Third, gossip is the most frequently cited social information channel but associates with lower protective action due to inaction norm transmission, while increasing spatial clustering of insurance adoption suggests a gradual transition from status quo reinforcement toward adaptation diffusion.

Methodologically, we demonstrated that LLM-governed ABMs with structured multi-level validation (mean EPI = 0.689 +/- 0.144) can generate credible CNHS simulations using small open-source language models (4 billion parameters), provided that institutional feasibility constraints enforce domain-theoretic coherence on agent decision-making processes. This approach offers a pathway for representing the heterogeneous, context-dependent nature of human adaptation decisions that traditional rule-based ABMs cannot capture.
