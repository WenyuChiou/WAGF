I've lived in this community for 19 years and have seen floods occur before. Although no flood occurred this year, the risk is still present.\n\n**Coping Appraisal:** Low because... my current income ($112,210) can easily cover the costs of buying insurance or elevating my house. The mortgage payment ($1,318) is manageable, so I don't feel financially strained.\n\nConsidering these appraisals, my Final Decision is: **buy_insurance (F"}, "approved_skill": {"skill_name": "do_nothing", "status": "APPROVED", "mapping": "sim.noop"}, "execution_result": {"success": true, "state_changes": {"has_insurance": false}, "error": null}, "retry_count": 0, "decision": "do_nothing", "input": "You are Agent_100, a homeowner in a flood-prone community.\n\nCONTEXT: tenure=19 years, income=112210, mortgage=1318\nSTATE: elevated=False, insurance=False\n\nOBSERVATIONS:\nYear 10\nNo flood occurred this year.\nTrust in Insurance: 0.48\nTrust in Neighbors: 0.21\n\nMEMORY:\n- Year 9: I observe 0% of my neighbors have relocated.\n- Year 10: No flood occurred this year.\n- Year 10: Elevation grants are available.\n- Year 10: I observe 0% of my neighbors have elevated homes.\n- Year 10: I observe 0% of my neighbors have relocated.\n\nENV: flood=False subsidy_available=0.0 insurance_premium=0.0\n\nCurrent Choice Set:\n\n- buy_insurance (FI): Purchase flood insurance\n- elevate_house (HE): Elevate house structure\n- relocate (RL): Relocate to safer area\n- do_nothing (DN): Take no action\n\n\nUsing Protection Motivation Theory logic:\n1.
