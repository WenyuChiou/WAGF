# JOH Technical Note Bibliography & Citation Map

## 1. The Gap: Generative Agents vs. Physical Reality

_References that establish the "Fluency-Reality Gap" and the need for governance._

- **[Park et al., 2023]** Park, J. S., et al. "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior." _arXiv preprint_.
  - _Usage_: Cite in **Introduction** to define the baseline capability (and failure mode) of unconstrained agents.
- **[Xi et al., 2023]** Xi, Z., et al. "The Rise and Potential of Large Language Model Based Agents: A Survey." _arXiv preprint_.
  - _Usage_: Contextualize the explosion of LLM agents.
- **[Gao et al., 2024]** Gao, J., et al. "Large Language Models Empowered Agent-based Modeling and Simulation: A Survey and Perspective."
  - _Usage_: establishing the trend of LLM-ABM in scientific domains.
- **[O'Brien et al., 2024]** O'Brien, F., et al. "AQUAH: Automatic Quantification and Unified Agent in Hydrology." _arXiv preprint_.
  - _Usage_: Construct the "Straw Man" - an excellent _task automation_ agent (Vision-LLM for HEC-RAS) that is distinct from our _social behavior_ (PMT) agent.
- **[Zhang et al., 2024]** Zhang, Y., et al. "WaterGPT and Water_Agent." _MDPI Water_.
  - _Usage_: Highlights LLM customization for hydrology domain knowledge.

## 2. The Theory: Grounding the Framework

_References that justify the "Enhanced" architecture._

- **[Rogers, 1975]** Rogers, R. W. "A Protection Motivation Theory of Fear Appeals and Attitude Change." _Journal of Psychology_.
  - _Usage_: **Methodology (Pillar 3)**. Justifies why we force agents to evaluate "Vulnerability" and "Efficacy" before acting.
- **[Sumers et al., 2023]** Sumers, T., et al. "Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA)." _arXiv preprint_.
  - _Usage_: **Methodology (Pillar 1)**. Defines the standard for "System 1 vs System 2" coupling. Our framework is a _concrete implementation_ of CoALA for hydrology.
- **[Kahneman, 2011]** Kahneman, D. "Thinking, Fast and Slow."
  - _Usage_: **Introduction**. Theoretical basis for separating "LLM Intuition" (Fast) from "Governance Rules" (Slow).

## 3. The Application: Hydro-Social Modeling

_References that validate the domain relevance._

- **[Di Baldassarre et al., 2013]** Di Baldassarre, G., et al. "Socio-hydrology: conceptualising human-flood interactions." _Hydrology and Earth System Sciences_.
  - _Usage_: **Introduction/Discussion**. Defines the "Levee Effect" and "Adaptation Effect" that our agents must reproduce.
- **[Mostafavi et al., 2018]** Mostafavi, A., et al. "Agent-based modeling of household decision-making in flood adaptation."
  - _Usage_: **Discussion**. Comparison with traditional rule-based ABMs.

## 4. Citation Strategy (Reviewer Defense)

- **Defense against "Black Box" critique**: Cite **CoALA** to show we are building on established AI architecture, not just "prompt engineering".
- **Defense against "Simplicity" critique**: Cite **PMT** (Rogers) to show our governance rules are psychologically grounded, not arbitrary if-then statements.
- **Defense against "Hallucination" critique**: Cite **Park et al. (2023)** to acknowledge the known limitation, then position our **"Tiered Environment"** as the solution.
