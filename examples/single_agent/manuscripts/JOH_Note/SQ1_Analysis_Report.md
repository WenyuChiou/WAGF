# SQ1 Analysis Report: The "Cognitive Equalizer" Effect

**Date**: January 2026
**Topic**: Research Question 1 (Rationality & Adaptation)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

To answer SQ1 (_"Does Reflective Governance improve rational adaptation?"_), we convened an simulated Expert Panel (Methodologist, Cognitive Scientist, Socio-Hydrologist) to analyze the experimental data across three model tiers (1.5B, 8B, 14B).

**The Core Finding**: Rationality is not a monotonic function of model size; it is a function of the **Architecture-Model Fit**.

- **For Small Models (1.5B)**: Governance is an **Existence Condition** (Prosthetic).
- **For Large Models (14B)**: Governance is a **Constraint Cost** (Rumination).

## 3. Mechanism Analysis

### 3.1 Mechanism I: The Prosthetic of Reason (The 1.5B Success)

**The Challenge**: In Group B (Simple Governance), the 1.5B model suffered a "Semantic Collapse", requiring **138 interventions** to output valid JSON. It lacked the cognitive working memory to hold both the _Simulation Context_ and the _Formatting Rules_ simultaneously.

**The Solution**: Type C (Reflective Governance) acted as a **Cognitive Prosthetic**. By forcing the model to externalize its thinking ("Reflection Step") _before_ making a decision, the architecture effectively "offloaded" the cognitive load.

- **Result**: Interventions dropped to **0**.
- **Rationality**: Alignment remained high (>0.90), proving that the model wasn't just following a template, but was correctly linking its (low) threat reception to its decision.

### 3.2 Mechanism II: The Cost of Rumination (The 14B Paradox)

**The Observation**: The 14B model is natively rational in Group A (Stability FF 0.56, Alignment 0.97).
**The Regression**: When subjected to Type C Governance, its stability **worsened** (FF 0.56 $\rightarrow$ 2.05).
**The Theory**: "Cognitive Over-Constraint". For a capable model, the mandatory reflection step introduces unnecessary semantic noise, causing the model to second-guess its initial (correct) intuition. This is the "Rumination Effect"—thinking too much leads to anxiety and flip-flopping.

## 4. Why Govern? The "Cognitive Architecture Trilemma"

Our data reveals a distinct "Cognitive Equalizer" effect, but with a critical caveat: **Governance is not a universal performance booster; it is a corrective mechanism that obeys the Law of Diminishing Returns.**

### 4.1 The "Invalid to Viable" Transformation (1.5B)

- **The Problem**: Without governance (Group A/B), the 1.5B model is **operationally invalid**. It either freezes (Group A) or hallucinates formats (Group B, 138 errors). It lacks the _working memory_ to hold simulation rules and context simultaneously.
- **The Governance Effect**: Type C acts as a **"Cognitive Prosthetic"**. By offloading the reasoning process to an external architecture ("Think first, then Act"), it:
  1.  Eliminates format errors (Intv $138 \rightarrow 0$).
  2.  Restores logical causal links (Alignment $0.91$).
  3.  Enables the small model to perform on par with 14B.
- **Verdict**: **Governance is Existential.** For small models, it is the difference between "broken" and "sota-level".

### 4.2 The "Panic to Hesitation" Correction (8B)

- **The Problem**: The 8B model exhibits "Panic Mode" (HiTA $0.96$). It treats every weather event as a catastrophe, rendering it scientifically useless for realistic simulation.
- **The Governance Effect**: Type C acts as a **"Mood Stabilizer"**.
  1.  It suppresses the panic response (HiTA $0.96 \rightarrow 0.43$).
  2.  It introduces a "Social Check" that lowers the Flip-Flop rate compared to the chaotic baseline (FF $1.86 \rightarrow 1.54$).
- **Verdict**: **Governance is Corrective.** It fixes the "Drama Queen" bias, though at the cost of some decisiveness (Alignment drops).

### 4.3 The "Rational to Rumination" Paradox (14B)

- **The Problem**: The 14B model is natively rational and stable (Group A). It does not need help.
- **The Governance Effect**: Type C acts as **"Cognitive Noise"**.
  1.  Forcing a capable agent to "re-think" valid intuitions leads to second-guessing.
  2.  This manifests as the **"Rumination Effect"**, where stability significantly degrades (FF $0.56 \rightarrow 2.05$).
- **Verdict**: **Governance is Redundant.** For high-intelligence models, heavy scaffolding interferes with native capabilities.

## 5. Conclusion: The Efficient Frontier

The study confirms that **Socio-Hydrological Simulations do not require massive models; they require Managed Models.**

> **"The Sweet Spot": 1.5B + Reflective Governance (Type C)**

This combination offers the **Stability of 14B** with the **Speed of 1.5B**, successfully "Equalizing" the playing field. This finding has profound implications for scaling ABMs to millions of agents without incurring prohibitive computational costs.
