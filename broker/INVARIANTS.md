# WAGF Framework Invariants

**Status**: authoritative — any change here requires review against `broker/tests/test_framework_invariants.py`.

**Audience**: anyone adding a new memory engine, audit column, cognitive module, social signal, validator module, or domain adapter under `broker/`.

**Why this document exists**: on 2026-04-19 the NW flood cross-model experiments shipped with a degraded memory pipeline (retrieved memories silently stripped of salience metadata, audit log showing `emotion="neutral"` for every row). The root cause was not a single bug — it was the absence of framework-level contracts that would have made the degradation detectable. This document codifies the contracts that must hold. If you catch yourself writing code that violates one of these, stop and either (a) revise your code, (b) revise this document with review, or (c) document a temporary exception in the code with an explicit expiry.

## Invariant 1 — Memory type contract

### Contract
```
MemoryRecord: TypedDict / dataclass with at minimum:
  - content:    str                # human-readable text
  - emotion:    str                # classification from domain emotion vocabulary
  - importance: float              # [0.0, 1.0], computed or authored
  - source:     str                # {personal, neighbor, community, abstract}
  - timestamp:  int                # simulation step or year
  - metadata:   Dict[str, Any]     # domain-specific extensions

MemoryEngine.retrieve(...) -> List[MemoryRecord]
MemoryEngine.retrieve_content_only(...) -> List[str]   # compatibility helper only
```

### Rules
1. Any subclass of `MemoryEngine` MUST preserve metadata in `retrieve()`. Returning bare `List[str]` from `retrieve()` is forbidden.
2. Callers that need `List[str]` for string-formatting MUST explicitly call `retrieve_content_only(...)`. The intent to discard metadata must be visible at the call site.
3. `add_memory(agent_id, content, metadata)` and `add_memory_for_agent(agent, content, metadata)` MUST both route through the same internal classification path (see Invariant 3).
4. If `metadata` is absent when adding a memory, the engine MAY invoke a classifier (e.g., `_classify_emotion`) to infer it, but MUST NOT silently discard missing fields by substituting arbitrary defaults. The inferred value MUST be distinguishable from a missing value via a marker (e.g., `metadata["emotion_inferred"] = True`).

### Detection / enforcement
- `broker/tests/test_framework_invariants.py::test_memory_engine_contract` — asserts every `MemoryEngine` subclass preserves metadata end-to-end for a synthetic critical memory.
- Base `MemoryEngine.__init_subclass__` — on import, verifies subclass `retrieve()` does not return bare `List[str]` (annotation-level check).

### Known current state (as of 2026-04-19)
- Base `retrieve()` declares `List[str]` return — this is the legacy contract being repaired on `feat/memory-pipeline-v2` by Codex. Target state is `List[MemoryRecord]`.
- `retrieve_content_only()` already exists (`broker/components/memory/engine.py:53-68`) as the compatibility helper.

## Invariant 2 — Audit integrity contract

### Contract
Every column in an audit CSV MUST correspond to one of:
- A real upstream signal, populated by at least one production code path.
- An explicit "reserved for future" column, documented in the schema with owner + expected-populator date.

### Rules
1. `AuditWriter` MUST NOT hardcode placeholder values that look like real data. `"neutral"`, `0.0`, `"personal"`, `False` are examples of values that silently mask missing upstream data — these MUST be replaced with explicit sentinels (`None`, `"UNSET"`, `NaN`) when the upstream is absent.
2. If a column's upstream is known to be absent for a given experiment (e.g., cognitive module parked for V2), the AuditWriter MUST emit ONE WARNING at experiment start naming the absent column(s); it MUST NOT write a placeholder value on every row.
3. Every column name in the audit schema MUST have at least one grep-locatable assignment in `broker/` or `examples/<domain>/` code. Orphan columns (declared but never written) are forbidden.
4. Aggregated columns (e.g., `mem_top_emotion` = max-frequency over retrieved memories) MUST document in the schema that they are aggregates, not per-row observations. Per-memory detail, if needed, belongs in a separate JSONL sidecar, not collapsed into single CSV cells.

### Detection / enforcement
- `test_audit_no_hardcoded_sentinels_leak` — synthetic run asserts `mem_top_emotion` shows variety when input memories have variety.
- `test_dormant_field_policy` — grep-scans that every audit column name has at least one writer in the codebase.
- Runtime: `AuditWriter.finalize()` checks for suspicious constancy (same value across 100+ rows) and logs WARNING.

### Known current state
- `broker/core/_audit_helpers.py:64` hardcodes `{"emotion": "neutral", "source": "personal"}` — being fixed by Codex Fix D on `feat/memory-pipeline-v2`.
- `broker/components/analytics/audit.py:325-330, 351-359` hardcodes `cog_*` and `social_*` defaults to `0` / `False` / `""` when upstream dicts absent — **will be fixed in Phase D of this plan** by replacing with `None` sentinels and one-time WARNING.

## Invariant 3 — API consistency contract

### Contract
Parallel API methods on the same domain concept MUST preserve identical metadata semantics.

### Rules
1. If two methods `foo(x, ...)` and `foo_for_y(y, x, ...)` exist and operate on the same concept, both MUST route through the same internal classification / validation path. The only legitimate difference should be which contextual inputs are available (e.g., whether an agent object is passed for per-agent emotion keyword overrides).
2. Prefer a single API with an optional `agent: Optional[BaseAgent] = None` parameter over two methods. Dual methods are allowed only when the two use cases have genuinely incompatible signatures; never for convenience.
3. Domain-facing code (examples/<domain>/) SHOULD call the agent-aware variant; if it must use the non-agent variant, it MUST pass explicit `metadata={"emotion": ..., "importance": ..., "source": ...}` to avoid fallback to a different classifier.

### Detection / enforcement
- `test_parallel_api_consistency` — adds the same content through both `add_memory` and `add_memory_for_agent`; asserts stored emotion classification is identical.
- Code review checklist in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (to be added): "Does this new method have a parallel variant? If yes, do both route through `_classify_metadata`?"

### Known current state
- `HumanCentricMemoryEngine.add_memory` vs `add_memory_for_agent`: the two methods diverge in emotion classification because `_classify_emotion(content, agent=None)` uses different keyword map than `_classify_emotion(content, agent=agent)`. Fix approach: introduce `_classify_metadata(content, agent=None, metadata=None)` as the single internal path both methods call.

## Invariant 4 — Dormant code policy

### Contract
Schema fields, dataclasses, and code paths MUST be either production-live or explicitly marked as reserved / deprecated.

### Rules
1. Audit CSV columns MUST be populated by at least one production code path OR declared in a `reserved_columns.yaml` with an owner and expected activation date.
2. Dataclasses defined but never constructed in production code MUST be marked `@deprecated` with a migration path in the docstring.
3. Abstract methods in protocols MUST have at least one concrete implementation imported in the default production graph. If a protocol has zero implementations, it MUST be removed or moved to an `experimental/` folder.
4. Constructor parameters accepted but never used MUST either be removed or documented in the docstring with a TODO for activation.

### Detection / enforcement
- `test_dormant_field_policy` — ties audit columns to writer grep results (same test as Invariant 2 rule 3).
- Manual review: quarterly scan for `@deprecated` markers older than 6 months; decide to activate or remove.

### Known current state (dormant items identified by 2026-04-19 audit)
- `broker/components/cognitive/trace.py::CognitiveTrace` — dataclass defined, never populated. **Will be marked `@deprecated` in Phase D** with a pointer to the future V2 cognitive module.
- `broker/components/cognitive/adapters.py::DomainReflectionAdapter` — protocol defined, zero implementations. Reflection.py hardcodes flood logic instead of using the adapter.
- `broker/components/orchestration/phases.py:48` — `saga_coordinator` parameter unused. Must be removed or activated.
- `broker/components/memory/engines/hierarchical.py::_consolidate` — no-op stub. Module already `@deprecated`; cleanup deferred to a separate hygiene pass.

---

## Invariant 5 — Domain-genericity contract

### Contract
Modules under `broker/components/` and `broker/core/` MUST be domain-agnostic. Domain-specific logic belongs in `examples/<domain>/` or behind `Adapter` protocol implementations.

### Rules
1. No field names like `elevated`, `flood_count`, `WSA`, `insurance`, `drought_tier` may appear in `broker/components/` or `broker/core/` Python code unless:
   - Inside a `domain_adapters/` sub-directory, OR
   - Inside a generic `custom_attributes: Dict[str, Any]` pass-through field, OR
   - On an explicit allow-list in `broker/tests/domain_tokens_allowlist.txt`.
2. Emotion keyword maps, importance heuristics, and validator rule sets MUST be injectable via domain adapter protocols — never hardcoded with one domain's vocabulary in generic code.
3. If a generic module has "default behavior for one particular domain" baked in, that behavior MUST be moved to an explicit default adapter that can be swapped.
4. Default skill names (e.g., `do_nothing`, `maintain`) MUST come from configuration, not from `broker/components/governance/registry.py` constants.

### Detection / enforcement
- `test_domain_genericity` — greps `broker/components/` and `broker/core/` for known domain tokens; allow-lists explicit exceptions.
- Code review: any new feature in `broker/` must pass the grep check.

### Known current state
- `broker/components/cognitive/reflection.py:198-213` — flood-specific importance calculation hardcoded (checks `flood_count`, `insurance`, `elevation`). **Will be moved behind `DomainReflectionAdapter` in Phase D.**
- `broker/components/prompt_templates/memory_templates.py` — class is entirely flood-specific (flood_zone, flood_experience). Acceptable if renamed to `flood_memory_templates.py` and moved to a domain subfolder.
- `broker/core/agent_initializer.py:52-56` — `AgentProfile` dataclass has flood-specific fields (elevated, insured, flood_count) as backwards-compat. Document as tech debt; plan deprecation once domain adapters land.
- `broker/components/governance/registry.py:34` — `_default_skill = "do_nothing"` hardcode assumes flood-like action set. **Will be fixed in Phase D** to accept config-driven domain default.

## Process rules

### Adding a new invariant
1. Draft the contract + rules + enforcement strategy.
2. Add a test to `broker/tests/test_framework_invariants.py`.
3. Run the test against current `main` — it should fail (revealing current state).
4. Fix the violations.
5. Land invariant + test + fixes together in one PR.
6. Update this document's "Known current state" section of the affected invariant.

### Relaxing an invariant
1. Document the use case that justifies relaxation.
2. Add the exception to the relevant allow-list file or mark the code path with an explicit `# noqa: invariant-N` comment with owner and justification.
3. Never silently skip the invariant check.

### Reviewing changes
Every PR that touches `broker/` should have the INVARIANTS.md row of the review template checked. Reviewer verifies no invariant is newly violated.
