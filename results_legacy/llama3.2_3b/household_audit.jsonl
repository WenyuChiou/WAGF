Your house is already elevated, which provides very good protection.\nYour memory includes:\n- Year 5: Elevation grants are available.\n- Year 5: I observe 2% of my neighbors have elevated homes.\n- Year 5: I observe 91% of my neighbors have relocated.\n\nYou currently do not have flood insurance.\nYou have slight doubts about the insurance company. You are skeptical of your neighbors' judgment.\n\nUsing the Protection Motivation Theory, evaluate your current situation by considering the following factors:\n- Perceived Severity: How serious the consequences of flooding feel to you.\n- Perceived Vulnerability: How likely you think you are to be affected.\n- Response Efficacy: How effective you believe each action is.\n- Self-Efficacy: Your confidence in your ability to take that action.\n- Response Cost: The financial and emotional cost of the action.\n- Maladaptive Rewards: The benefit of doing nothing immediately.\n\nNow, choose one of the following actions:\n1. Buy flood insurance (Lower cost, provides partial financial protection but does not reduce physical damage)\n2. Relocate (Requires leaving your neighborhood but eliminates flood risk permanently)\n3. Do nothing (Require no financial investment or effort this year, but it might leave you exposed to future flood damage)\nNote: If no flood occurred this year, since no immediate threat, most people would choose “Do Nothing.”\n                                                                                              \nPlease respond using the exact format below.
