We propose a governance architecture that validates natural-language agent reasoning against modular physical and institutional rules. In a 42-year Colorado River irrigation simulation, governed agents extracted more water than ungoverned agents while maintaining drought responsiveness — adaptive exploitation consistent with prior-appropriation dynamics that parameterized models cannot represent. Institutional rules created feasibility boundaries within which agents developed differentiated strategies autonomously, producing higher strategy diversity than both ungoverned agents and a hand-coded baseline. Targeted removal of a single rule — the demand ceiling linking individual proposals to basin-wide demand — increased diversity but decoupled it from drought signals, nearly doubling shortage frequency and distinguishing adaptive from arbitrary diversity. The effect generalized from chronic drought (78 agents, 42 years) to acute flood hazard (100 agents, 10 years), was positive for five of six model scales tested, and governance reduced irrational behaviour rates from 0.8–11.6% to below 1.7%, significantly for four of six models. Institutional boundaries widen adaptive capacity in ways that fixed decision rules cannot represent.

### Word count: ~145
### Changes from v10b → v14:
- Complete rewrite following expert panel consensus
- Water finding leads (adaptive exploitation), not conceptual claim ("constraints expected to reduce...")
- Method is implicit, water science is the subject
- Removed: "constraint paradox", "behavioural entropy", "EHE", "model scales" as standalone phrase
- Added: "adaptive exploitation", "feasibility boundaries", "adaptive vs arbitrary diversity"
- A1 ablation finding given full sentence
- Cross-domain stated as water hazard types, not model robustness
