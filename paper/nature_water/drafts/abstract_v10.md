Constraints are conventionally expected to reduce available actions. We find the opposite: institutional boundary enforcement increases realized behavioural diversity in language-based water agents, and this diversity reshapes water-system outcomes. In a governed architecture where open-weight language models generate decision proposals validated against physical and institutional rules, we test this effect across Colorado River irrigation (78 agents, 42 years) and household flood adaptation (100 agents, 10 years, 6 models). Governed agents achieve higher diversity than both ungoverned agents and a hand-coded Protection Motivation Theory baseline, eliminating constraint violations. Governed agents extract more water during favourable conditions and curtail during drought; ungoverned agents collapse into rigid demand increases. Targeted removal of a single governance rule increases diversity further but decouples it from drought responsiveness, distinguishing adaptive from arbitrary diversity. The effect is positive across all six model scales, significant for five. Institutional boundaries widen adaptive capacity that fixed decision rules cannot represent.
