## Discussion

Governed language-based agents exploit water resources more aggressively during favourable conditions and curtail proportionately during drought — a pattern of adaptive exploitation that emerges from institutional boundary enforcement rather than programmed decision rules. This addresses the central question of whether computational governance can create conditions for adaptive water management: not by prescribing behaviour, but by defining institutional boundaries within which diverse strategies become viable. Governed agents adjusted demand in response to reservoir state (r = 0.547) substantially more than ungoverned agents (r = 0.378) while extracting a larger share of their water entitlements. In prior-appropriation-inspired systems, this parallels how shortage-sharing rules enable rights holders to extract their full entitlement in normal years because those rules ensure proportionate curtailment during drought — the institution does not reduce water use, it makes higher use safe.

The demand ceiling ablation reveals the mechanism. Removing this single rule — which links individual demand proposals to aggregate basin state — increased diversity but collapsed demand–Mead coupling and nearly doubled shortage frequency. This separates two properties that institutional theory has long distinguished but never quantified in simulation: diversity (wider repertoire of actions used) and adaptive diversity (actions deployed in response to system state). Ostrom (1990) observed that well-designed institutions for common-pool resource management create structured arenas within which diverse adaptive strategies become viable. Our computational results produce a structurally analogous outcome: governance validators define feasibility boundaries within which language models generate a wider range of valid strategies coupled to environmental conditions. Without these boundaries, agents collapse into repetitive patterns — not because they lack capacity, but because unconstrained generation produces invalid proposals that crowd out meaningful variation. We emphasize that the parallel is structural: Ostrom's analysis involves strategic interaction and norm internalization, whereas our validators operate as stateless constraint checks. Whether informal norms emerge from repeated agent interaction remains untested.

The capacity to experimentally decompose institutional rules transforms language-based agents from simulation tools into computational laboratories for water governance. In the ablation demonstrated here, removing one of twelve rules isolated the mechanism coupling individual decisions to basin state. The same approach could test variations in shortage-sharing thresholds (for example, shifting Tier 1 from 1,075 ft to 1,050 ft), alternative allocation regimes (proportional versus priority-based curtailment), premium structures for flood insurance, or drought contingency plan triggers — observing how populations of reasoning agents endogenously adapt their strategies within physically valid bounds. This capacity is distinct from exploratory modelling (Bankes, 1993) and sensitivity analysis in that the behavioural responses are generated, not sampled from predefined parameter spaces. The rule-based PMT comparison quantifies the representational gain: governed language agents produced higher behavioural diversity than hand-coded agents using the same behavioural theory with parameterized heterogeneity, because language-based reasoning generates qualitatively different strategies that threshold-based rules cannot represent. A fuzzy Q-learning baseline (Hung & Yang, 2021) achieved comparable demand ratios but near-zero demand–Mead coupling (r = 0.057 versus 0.547 governed), confirming that the adaptive exploitation pattern requires the natural-language reasoning format, not merely the governance constraints (Supplementary Note 11).

Governance also reveals reasoning patterns that illuminate how agents behave at institutional boundaries. Because the governance pipeline records every blocked proposal alongside the agent's natural-language reasoning, governance creates an audit trail of decisions that agents attempted but the institution prevented. During Tier 3 shortage, for example, an agent reasoned: "my previous aggressive increase failed... given my scepticism of forecasts, I will cautiously increase" — acknowledging failure while repeating it (see Supplementary Note 2 for paired reasoning traces). Across all governed runs, 42% of high-scarcity decisions still attempted demand increases despite drought signals. Governed BRI (58%) approximates the null expectation under uniform random action selection (60%), indicating that governance eliminates the directional increase-bias of ungoverned agents (BRI 9.4%) rather than optimizing decisions toward rationality (Table 1). Governance does not eliminate maladaptive water-use reasoning; it intercepts the proposal before execution and records the reasoning trace that produced it. This diagnostic capacity has no analogue in conventional water-resource agent models, where agents execute programmed allocation rules and cannot generate proposals that violate those rules.

The tendency of governed agents to attempt demand increases during scarcity has empirical precedent in prior-appropriation-inspired systems, where irrigators historically increase diversions in anticipation of curtailment. Our governance architecture suppresses these proposals; future designs could distinguish between physically infeasible allocations and institutionally prohibited-but-observed diversion strategies, preserving them as diagnostic windows into water-use reasoning under scarcity. This distinguishes boundary constraints (what agents cannot do) from prescriptive constraints (what agents should do) — the majority of our rules enforce the former, leaving strategy selection to the agent.

Several scope conditions apply. The governance effect on behavioural diversity is strongest for the smallest models (Gemma-3 4B: +0.329) and weakest for the largest (Ministral 8B: −0.024, Ministral 14B: +0.033). This pattern is consistent with two interpretations: governance compensates for limited model capability, or larger models already approach their diversity ceiling, leaving less room for governance to expand. The current design cannot distinguish these mechanisms; experiments with instruction-tuned models of equivalent scale but different capability profiles would clarify. Only one model (Gemma-3 4B) was tested in the irrigation domain; the multi-scale analysis is limited to flood. Both model families are instruction-tuned language models; generalization to reasoning-specialized architectures remains untested. The reservoir model simplifies the full CRSS system to a single reservoir; results should be interpreted as stylized institutional dynamics. Each domain required substantial configuration (personas, validators, action registries); transferability refers to the governance architecture, not the configuration effort. We note that doubling the insurance premium rate reversed the governance diversity effect in the flood domain (Supplementary Note 5), indicating that the adaptive diversity we observe depends on the institutional parameter configuration and is not an unconditional property of governance. Despite these limitations, the consistency of the governance effect — positive for five of six model scales on diversity, with significant reduction of irrational behaviour for four of six (directionally consistent in all six), across both water domains, and against a hand-coded baseline — suggests that institutional boundary enforcement is a robust mechanism for enabling adaptive behavioural diversity in language-based water simulation. The question for water research shifts from whether language-based agents can represent human water reasoning to what institutional designs best govern that reasoning — and what those designs reveal about the adaptive capacity institutions create.
