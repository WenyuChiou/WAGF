## Discussion

For three decades, agent-based models have represented water-decision heterogeneity through parameterized variation: agents draw risk tolerance from distributions, sample discount rates, and are assigned behavioural types, but every agent follows the same hand-crafted decision rules (Schluter et al., 2017). This approach achieves behavioural coherence by construction but cannot generate reasoning diversity that was not explicitly programmed. The rule-based PMT comparison quantifies this limitation: despite incorporating empirically grounded threat and coping appraisal logic, the hand-coded agent achieved lower decision diversity (EHE = 0.689) than governed language agents (0.752) operating under the same flood conditions. The diversity gap is qualitative, not parametric — governed agents produce decision rationales that reference trade-offs, personal circumstances, and contextual factors in ways that threshold-based rules cannot represent, while governance validators ensure these reasoning outputs remain physically and institutionally valid.

This finding addresses the central question posed by the Introduction: can language-based agents provide a computationally governed representation of how people reason about water decisions? The irrigation results suggest yes — with a qualification. Governed agents do not simply diversify outputs; they reshape water-system trajectories. Under governance, agents extracted more water during favourable conditions while curtailing during drought (r = 0.547 between Mead elevation and demand), a pattern consistent with adaptive prior-appropriation management. Ungoverned agents collapsed into monotonic demand increases (77-82%), producing rigid trajectories driven by ceiling clamps rather than adaptive choice. Governed agents maintained drought responsiveness comparable to ungoverned agents (curtailment spread 0.084 versus 0.083) at 53% higher absolute extraction — paralleling real prior-appropriation dynamics where senior rights holders extract more in normal years and curtail more in absolute terms during shortage. The water-system implication is that behavioural diversity is not merely a statistical property but a functional capacity: governance shifts the operating point without altering the adaptive capacity, and agents with access to the full repertoire of demand-management strategies interact with the physical system differently than agents trapped in behavioural monoculture.

The mechanism connecting governance to diversity parallels an insight from institutional theory. Ostrom (1990) observed that well-designed rules for managing common-pool resources create structured arenas within which diverse adaptive strategies become viable. Our computational results produce a structurally analogous outcome: governance validators define feasibility boundaries (mass balance, physical possibility, institutional eligibility) within which language models produce a wider range of valid responses. Without these boundaries, agents collapse into repetitive patterns — not because they lack capacity, but because unconstrained generation produces invalid proposals that accumulate, crowding out meaningful variation. We note that the parallel is at the level of outcomes rather than mechanisms: Ostrom's institutional analysis involves strategic interaction and norm internalization among human actors, whereas our validators operate as stateless constraint checks. In North's (1990) taxonomy, our governance architecture implements formal rules; whether informal norms emerge from repeated agent interactions remains untested. The A1 ablation provides direct evidence for this distinction. Removing the demand ceiling — a boundary constraint linking individual proposals to aggregate basin state — increased diversity (EHE +0.055) but collapsed drought coupling (r from 0.547 to 0.234) and nearly doubled shortage years (13.3 to 25.3). This separates two properties often conflated: diversity (more action types used) and adaptive diversity (action types deployed in response to system state). Governance produces the latter; unconstrained generation produces only the former.

This interpretation distinguishes boundary constraints from prescriptive constraints. The majority of our governance rules specify what agents cannot do (violate mass balance, re-elevate an already-elevated home) rather than what they should do. A prescriptive layer that rewards specific decisions would likely suppress diversity, consistent with conventional expectations. The null-model comparison illustrates: governed agents achieved a BRI of 58% versus 60% expected under random action selection, indicating governance removes systematic bias without imposing directional structure. We measure diversity as an empirical outcome, not a normative good; whether wider behavioural repertoires improve water-system resilience depends on the institutional context.

The diversity effect's consistency across model scales (all six non-negative, five significant; Table 4) strengthens the core finding while revealing variation in magnitude. The effect was largest where ungoverned agents exhibited behavioural monoculture and smallest where both conditions already converged on similar action distributions (Gemma-3 12B; see SI). Even where the diversity effect was modest, governance eliminated constraint violations entirely — a benefit not captured by EHE. Several scope conditions apply. Only one model (Gemma-3 4B) was tested in the irrigation domain; the multi-scale analysis is limited to flood. Governance rules and benchmarks were designed by the same team; true independence requires pre-registration. Each domain required substantial configuration (personas, skill registries, validator stacks); transferability refers to the architecture, not the configuration effort. Both model families are instruction-tuned decoder-only transformers; generalization to reasoning-specialized or mixture-of-experts architectures remains untested. Temperature (0.8) interacts differently across architectures, and no sensitivity analysis was conducted. Governed agents receive governance feedback on retries, which may diversify subsequent reasoning through context enrichment distinct from rejection sampling. The flood domain uses stochastic events with only three distinct sequences across seeds.

These shortage-inconsistent and risk-action inconsistent behaviours correspond to what the behavioural literature broadly terms irrational decision-making under uncertainty (Simon, 1955; Kahneman, 2003). Of 3,955 governance-blocked proposals across three seeds, systematic classification identified three dominant reasoning patterns: strategic overshooting (82% — agents explicitly preferring to over-request), failure escalation (37% — past unmet demand triggering larger requests), and forecast skepticism (22% — dismissing scarcity signals). A representative case selected by median reasoning length from the skepticism category illustrates the pattern: during Tier 3 shortage with Lake Mead near 1,000 ft, an agent reasoned "my previous aggressive increase failed to yield any water... given my skepticism of forecasts, I'll cautiously increase my demand" — acknowledging failure while repeating it. One limitation of rule enforcement is that it suppresses such behaviours, which, while appearing irrational, have empirical precedent: prior-appropriation systems routinely incentivize pre-curtailment acceleration. Future designs could distinguish between physically impossible actions and institutionally unsanctioned-but-observed strategies, preserving them as a window into reasoning under extreme stress.

Governed language agents function as computational laboratories for water governance — an approach related to exploratory modelling (Bankes, 1993; Kwakkel and Pruyt, 2013) but generating behavioural responses endogenously rather than sampling from predefined parameter spaces. Researchers can systematically vary institutional rules — premium structures, drought triggers, allocation regimes — and observe how populations of reasoning agents respond within physically valid bounds. These agents do not predict what people will do; they generate outputs consistent with what people might plausibly reason toward, within the constraints that will shape their choices. Targeted ablation — removing the demand ceiling, varying insurance premiums, stripping governance memory — would establish causal mechanisms. Though the diversity effect varies in magnitude across model scales, the question shifts from whether language agents can represent water-decision reasoning to what institutional designs best govern that reasoning.
