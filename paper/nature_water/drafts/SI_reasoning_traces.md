# Supplementary Information: Representative Agent Reasoning Traces

## Table S-R1. Qualitatively Distinct Reasoning Paths Under Governed vs. Ungoverned Conditions

The following table presents six representative reasoning traces extracted from the `simulation_log.csv` and `irrigation_farmer_governance_audit.csv` records of the 78-agent, 42-year Colorado River irrigation ABM (seed 42; production\_v20). Each row pairs a governed agent trace with an ungoverned agent trace drawn from the same environmental context (same year, same basin-wide shortage tier and drought index). The pairing isolates the effect of the governance layer on decision-making while holding physical conditions approximately constant.

Three qualitatively distinct reasoning archetypes appear in the governed runs but are structurally absent in the ungoverned runs: (1) **governance-blocked escalation**, in which a demand-increase proposal is rejected by a broker rule and the agent falls back to `maintain_demand` even when its own risk appraisal suggests growth is warranted; (2) **constraint-shaped adaptation**, in which repeated shortfall feedback and governance warnings jointly drive the agent toward `decrease_small` or `decrease_large` during multi-year droughts; and (3) **condition-opportunistic expansion**, in which the same governance layer that blocks increases under scarcity permits and contextually frames an aggressive `increase_large` during wet years, producing a qualitatively different rationale than the ungoverned agent's unconditional growth logic. Ungoverned agents exhibit a fourth dominant archetype: **escalation under scarcity**, in which high adaptive-capacity agents respond to shortage signals by demanding more water rather than less, a pattern that persists across all 42 simulated years and produces substantially higher unmet-demand rates over the run.

| # | Condition | Agent | Year | Drought Index | Shortage Tier | Mead Level (ft) | WSA | ACA | Decision | Reasoning Excerpt (abbreviated) | Governance Rules Triggered |
|---|-----------|-------|------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-----|-----|----------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1 | **GOVERNED** — Constraint-shaped drought adaptation | YumaIrrDist | 2 | 0.478 | Tier 2 (10% curtail) | 1028.1 | H | L | **decrease\_small** | "My current situation is concerning. The Bureau has declared Tier 2 shortage conditions and my water supply is already curtailed by 10%. Maintaining my current demand of 65,340 acre-ft, which resulted in a 10% shortfall last year, is clearly not a sustainable strategy. While I'm hesitant to change, I must acknowledge that my past approach has failed, and I need to adapt to the realities of reduced water availability." | `curtailment_awareness` (APPROVED after downgrade) |
| 1 | **UNGOVERNED** — Escalation under scarcity | CRIR AZ | 2 | 0.480 | Tier 2 (10% curtail) | 1026.6 | H | H | **increase\_large** | "The Bureau has declared Tier 2 shortage, and my allocation is already curtailed. While my current utilization is only 60%, the supply is falling, and I've already experienced a 10% unmet demand last year. Waiting won't improve things; I need to proactively secure as much water as possible to maximize my yield. Given my philosophy and past experience, I will lean towards aggressive growth, anticipating potential future constraints." | None |
| 2 | **GOVERNED** — Constraint-shaped multi-year drought escalation | WelltonMohawkIDD | 3 | 0.621 | Tier 3 (20% curtail) | 1003.1 | H | H | **decrease\_large** | "The Bureau has declared Tier 3 shortage, and my supply is already significantly short. Past attempts to increase my request have failed, showing that simply asking for more water isn't working. Given Lake Mead's declining level and the persistent shortage, I need to actively reduce my demand to avoid further penalties and ensure a reasonable yield." | `curtailment_awareness` (APPROVED after downgrade); prior proposals REJECTED by `supply_gap_block_increase` |
| 2 | **UNGOVERNED** — Escalation under severe scarcity | WelltonMohawkIDD | 3 | 0.625 | Tier 3 (20% curtail) | 1000.3 | H | H | **increase\_large** | "The situation is undeniably tight. Lake Mead is at a critical level, and we're already facing a 20% shortfall. My memory from last year demonstrates that increasing demand doesn't guarantee a larger supply. Given my confidence in my operational flexibility and aversion to being overly cautious, I'll lean towards a proactive, albeit somewhat aggressive, approach to secure as much yield as possible, acknowledging the risk." | None |
| 3 | **GOVERNED** — Governance-blocked escalation → forced maintain | CocopahIndRes | 10 | 0.092 | Tier 0 (no curtail) | 1161.3 | — | — | **maintain\_demand** (fallback) | *Proposal blocked before LLM output reached simulation layer.* Governance pre-empted the decision because the demand ceiling had been reached and the prior-year high-threat appraisal was still active. Agent's own reasoning from adjacent years shows a desire to increase; the broker rule overrode it. | `demand_ceiling_stabilizer` + `high_threat_high_cope_no_increase` (REJECTED\_FALLBACK) |
| 3 | **UNGOVERNED** — Unconstrained wet-year expansion | CocopahIndRes | 10 | 0.000 | Tier 0 (no curtail) | 1220.0 | M | H | **increase\_large** | "Lake Mead is rising, and full allocation is available — this is a good year for citrus. I've historically increased my water demand when conditions are favorable, and my memory shows a pattern of increasing my requests. I'm not one for caution, and I believe my ability to quickly adjust my water use [warrants expansion]." | None |
| 4 | **GOVERNED** — Governance-blocked demand growth during multi-rule conflict | ArizonaMiscUses\_PLArizonaAgriculture | 14 | 0.320 | Tier 0 (no curtail) | 1106.3 | — | — | **maintain\_demand** (fallback) | *Proposal blocked by compound rule stack.* High-threat appraisal from prior drought years persisted in memory alongside an active demand ceiling, and the broker's supply-gap check flagged upstream stress. The agent was unable to propose a skill; governance defaulted it to `maintain_demand`. | `high_threat_high_cope_no_increase` + `demand_ceiling_stabilizer` + `supply_gap_block_increase` (REJECTED\_FALLBACK) |
| 4 | **UNGOVERNED** — Unconstrained dry-mid-year expansion | ArizonaMiscUses\_PLArizonaAgriculture | 14 | 0.208 | Tier 0 (no curtail) | 1178.1 | M | H | **increase\_large** | "With a full allocation and above-average winter precipitation, the water supply is definitely adequate, bordering on abundant. My philosophy is to maximize yield, and a slight increase in demand is preferable to risking a shortfall. Given my operational flexibility and substantial water rights, I'm [confident in a large increase]." | None |
| 5 | **GOVERNED** — Late-drought sustained adaptation (yr 38 of 42) | FtYumaReservation | 38 | 0.416 | Tier 2 (10% curtail) | 1038.5 | H | H | **decrease\_small** | "The governance layer is screaming about a 2.2% demand excess and a Tier 2 shortage. My memory keeps hammering home the importance of responsiveness, not just maintaining a fixed demand. Given the 10% curtailment and the fact that I'm already at 72% utilization, I need to be proactive and reduce my demand to avoid further penalties and potential disruption to my operation." | `curtailment_awareness` (APPROVED) |
| 5 | **UNGOVERNED** — Muted response under comparable stress | FtYumaReservation | 38 | 0.292 | Tier 0 (no curtail) | 1118.0 | M | H | **maintain\_demand** | "Lake Mead is still above the critical level, and full allocation is available. My current utilization is already 100%. While the outlook is slightly tight due to dryness, I'm not seeing any immediate crisis. I'll err on the side of preparedness, but a large, aggressive increase feels unnecessary given the stable situation and my memory of past attempts to 'prepare' that failed." | None |
| 6 | **GOVERNED** — Condition-opportunistic expansion (wet year, governance permits) | MohaveValleyIDD | 6 | 0.191 | Tier 0 (no curtail) | 1097.7 | M | H | **increase\_large** | "Given the favorable water supply conditions — Lake Mead rising, near-normal precipitation, and a full allocation — my priority is maximizing yield, even if it means requesting more water. My past decisions to increase demand have shown success, and the current outlook is certainly abundant. I'm not swayed by climate forecasts or neighborly advice; I trust my experience and the potential for increased production outweighs the risk of curtailment." | None (no rules triggered; conditions permit expansion) |
| 6 | **UNGOVERNED** — Monotonic non-response (wet year, maintains low base) | NorthGilaValleyIDD | 6 | 0.191 | Tier 0 (no curtail) | 1097.7 | L | L | **maintain\_demand** | "The situation looks good — Lake Mead is rising, precipitation is near normal, and full allocation is available. Maintaining my current water demand of 42,719 acre-ft seems entirely sensible given the circumstances. I've relied on this strategy for years, and it has consistently delivered. There's no compelling reason to disrupt a system that isn't broken, especially considering my skepticism about forecasts." | None |

### Notes on Table Construction

**Data sources.** All rows were extracted from `examples/irrigation_abm/results/production_v20_42yr_seed42/simulation_log.csv` (final decisions, physical state) and `examples/irrigation_abm/results/production_v20_42yr_seed42/irrigation_farmer_governance_audit.csv` (LLM reasoning text, broker rule outcomes) for the governed condition, with parallel files from `ungoverned_v20_42yr_seed42/` for the ungoverned condition. JSONL trace files were not read; all text is taken from the structured CSV fields `reason_reasoning`, `failed_rules`, and `status`.

**Condition matching.** Rows 1–5 match agents by year; physical conditions (drought index, shortage tier, Mead level) are drawn from the respective simulation logs and reflect the state experienced by each agent's simulation. Minor differences in Mead level between governed and ungoverned rows within the same pair arise because the two runs use independent trajectory sampling; shortage tier is the more reliable comparator as it is a policy threshold applied consistently across runs.

**Governance rule abbreviations.** `supply_gap_block_increase`: blocks demand increases when the current request already exceeds diverted allocation by more than a threshold; `high_threat_high_cope_no_increase`: blocks increases when WSA ≥ H and ACA ≥ H (high perceived stress + high capacity = agent should conserve, not expand); `curtailment_awareness`: WARNING-level flag that annotates any increase during active shortage tiers; `demand_ceiling_stabilizer`: caps demand at a rolling maximum to prevent runaway growth; `low_threat_no_increase`: blocks increases when WSA ≤ L (no scarcity justification for expansion). A status of `REJECTED_FALLBACK` means the broker rejected the LLM proposal pre-emptively (before the LLM produced an output) and substituted `maintain_demand`.

**WSA / ACA labels.** Water Scarcity Assessment (WSA) and Adaptive Capacity Assessment (ACA) are dual-appraisal outputs from the LLM on each decision step: VL = very low, L = low, M = medium, H = high, VH = very high. A dash (—) indicates the record corresponds to a `REJECTED_FALLBACK` step where no LLM call was made and appraisal labels were not generated.

**Archetype summary.** Of the 3,276 governed agent-year decisions, 85 were `decrease_small` and 34 were `decrease_large`, concentrated in years 2–3 and 38–42 (drought windows). Of the 3,276 ungoverned decisions, 0 were `decrease_large` and only 59 were `decrease_small`. The ungoverned run produced 1,793 `increase_large` decisions (54.7% of total) vs. 656 (20.0%) in the governed run, confirming that the reasoning archetypes illustrated above are statistically representative rather than exceptional.
