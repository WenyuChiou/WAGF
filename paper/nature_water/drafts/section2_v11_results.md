## Results

### Institutional rules enable adaptive exploitation of water resources

Three experimental conditions reveal complementary requirements for adaptive water management (Fig. 2, Table 1; all irrigation results use Gemma-3 4B, 78 agents × 42 years). To assess whether individual water-use decisions respond to basin-wide drought signals — the central coordination challenge in shared water systems — we measure demand–reservoir coupling as the Pearson correlation (r) between annual Lake Mead elevation and aggregate demand ratio; positive r indicates agents reduce demand when the reservoir drops. Governed language agents achieved high extraction (demand ratio 0.394) with strong drought coupling (r = 0.547). A fuzzy Q-learning baseline (FQL; Hung and Yang, 2021) extracted nearly identical volumes (0.395) but with near-zero coupling (r = 0.057), demonstrating that institutional rules alone do not produce drought responsiveness. Ungoverned language agents showed low extraction (0.288) with moderate coupling (0.378), reflecting behavioural collapse rather than adaptive restraint — 77–82% of their decisions were demand increases that converged on a code-level simulation maximum over 42 years. Together, these results indicate that adaptive exploitation — high extraction coupled to drought signals — requires natural-language reasoning operating within institutional boundaries, not either component alone (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Note 11).

Governed agents extracted more water yet responded more sensitively to drought. Lake Mead was consequently lower under governance (42-year mean 1,094 ft versus 1,173 ft) and governed agents triggered shortage conditions more frequently (13.3 versus 5.0 of 42 years). While the higher shortage frequency reflects the costs of aggressive resource exploitation, it demonstrates that governed agents engage productively with system constraints rather than avoiding them. The minimum Mead elevation was comparable (governed 1,002 ft versus ungoverned 1,001 ft), confirming that both systems reached the physical floor during severe early drought; the divergence occurred during recovery, where governed agents adaptively adjusted demand while ungoverned agents could not.

This pattern — higher extraction during abundance, proportionate response to scarcity signals — is consistent with adaptive exploitation under prior-appropriation-inspired institutional rules — the seniority-based water rights framework governing western US rivers, where senior rights holders maintain full diversions until drought-tier curtailment begins. In real Colorado River management, shortage tiers and delivery obligations enable senior rights holders to utilize water aggressively in normal years because those rules guarantee curtailment during drought. Governed agents display a structurally analogous dynamic: institutional validators made it safe to extract more water by ensuring that drought-inappropriate proposals were blocked before execution. The water-system consequence is that governance shifts the equilibrium demand level upward without degrading drought responsiveness.

*Three independent runs per condition (seeds 42, 43, 44). Demand ratio = requested volume / historical baseline allocation. Demand–Mead coupling = Pearson r between annual Lake Mead elevation and annual mean demand ratio (positive r indicates agents reduce demand during drought). Behavioural diversity = normalized Shannon entropy H/log₂(k) over k action types (0 = all agents choose the same action; 1 = actions uniformly distributed; see Methods). BRI = Behavioural Rationality Index, the fraction of high-scarcity decisions where agents did not increase demand (null expectation under uniform random = 60%); BRI ≈ 1 − IBR but uses a domain-specific high-scarcity subset (for the analogous flood-domain metric, see IBR in Table 2; see Methods). "No ceiling" removes only the demand-ceiling stabilizer (see next section). FQL uses the same reservoir model and governance validators but replaces natural-language reasoning with a Q-learning decision kernel (2-action: increase/decrease); behavioural diversity and BRI are not computed because 84–89% of FQL actions resulted from validator blocking rather than agent choice (Supplementary Note 11). See Supplementary Table 6 for additional water-system metrics.*

### A single institutional rule couples individual decisions to basin-wide drought

To identify which institutional rules create the coupling between individual decisions and reservoir state, we removed a single validator — the demand ceiling stabilizer, which blocks demand-increase proposals when aggregate basin demand exceeds 6.0 million acre-feet (MAF) — while retaining all eleven other validators (the "no-ceiling" condition; see Methods).

Removing this one rule of twelve collapsed demand–Mead coupling from r = 0.547 to 0.234, nearly doubled shortage years from 13.3 to 25.3, and dropped minimum Mead elevation to 984 ft below the Tier 3 shortage threshold (Table 1, "No Ceiling" column). Yet removing the ceiling *increased* behavioural diversity from 0.738 to 0.793. Agents diversified further — but into extraction patterns decoupled from drought signals, producing higher demand ratios (0.440 versus 0.394) with weaker environmental responsiveness.

This establishes a distinction central to interpreting the governance effect: between *diversity* (a wider action distribution) and *adaptive diversity* (an action distribution coupled to environmental state). The demand ceiling does not suppress diversity; it channels diversity toward drought-responsive patterns. Without it, agents diversify into individually rational but collectively maladaptive extraction — the hallmark of commons dilemmas that Ostrom (1990) identified as the target of institutional design.

The demand ceiling is the only one of twelve validators linking individual proposals to aggregate basin state. Its removal demonstrates that governance-induced diversity is functionally adaptive, not a statistical artefact of constraint-based rejection. This experimental decomposition — isolating one institutional rule's contribution to human-water coupling — would be impossible in conventional agent-based models where institutional rules are embedded in code and cannot be independently manipulated.

### Governance generates behavioural diversity beyond what hand-coded models can represent

Governed agents exhibited higher behavioural diversity than both ungoverned agents and a hand-coded Protection Motivation Theory baseline across both water domains. In irrigation, governed behavioural diversity (0.738 ± 0.017) exceeded ungoverned (0.637 ± 0.017) with zero distributional overlap across three seeds (Table 1). In flood adaptation, the ordering was consistent: governed language agents (0.636 ± 0.044) exceeded rule-based PMT agents (0.486 ± 0.011), which exceeded ungoverned language agents (0.307 ± 0.059; Table 2). Ungoverned agents collapsed into behavioural monoculture: 77–82% demand increases in irrigation, 85.9% inaction in flood.

This diversity is generated by agents reasoning within governance, not filtered into existence by validators. Proposals submitted before any governance feedback already showed higher diversity (first-attempt behavioural diversity 0.761 governed versus 0.640 ungoverned; irrigation domain), confirming that the governance context shapes the reasoning process, rather than diversity being created post hoc by the rejection-retry mechanism (see Supplementary Information for retry statistics).

The rule-based PMT agent's diversity stems entirely from parameterized variation: agents differ in income, flood zone, and prior experience, producing different threshold crossings, but all follow identical decision logic. Governed language agents achieve higher diversity through qualitatively different reasoning paths — agents develop rationales referencing personal trade-offs, contextual factors, and institutional constraints in ways that threshold-based rules cannot represent. Under identical physical conditions (same year, same shortage tier, same reservoir elevation), four governed agents selected four different actions through distinct cognitive frames: opportunity-seeking under self-assessed confidence, reflective learning from consolidated memory of past failure, tradition-anchored inertia despite the agent's own memory advising otherwise, and social responsibility referencing neighbour dependence (Supplementary Tables 3–5 present full reasoning traces and a taxonomy of 10 distinct cognitive frames). This is not a marginal improvement in the same representational format; it is a shift from parameterized homogeneity to reasoning-generated heterogeneity.

**Table 2. Behavioural diversity: governed LLM vs rule-based PMT vs ungoverned LLM (flood domain, Gemma-3 4B, 100 agents × 10 years, 3 runs each).**

| Condition | Behavioural diversity | IBR (%) | do_nothing (%) | insurance (%) | elevation (%) | relocation (%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Governed language agent** | **0.636 ± 0.044** | 0.86 | 35.6 | 50.7 | 10.6 | 3.0 |
| **Rule-based PMT** | **0.486 ± 0.011** | 0.0 | 69.7 | 21.3 | 8.7 | 0.0 |
| **Ungoverned language agent** | **0.307 ± 0.059** | 1.15 | 85.9 | 11.7 | 2.3 | 0.0 |

*Behavioural diversity = mean of per-year normalized Shannon entropy H/log₂(k) over active years (0 = monoculture; 1 = uniform); mean ± s.d. over 3 runs. Action percentages for rule-based agents are computed from yearly state transitions (new actions only); combined insurance-and-elevation events (<1%) are counted as elevation. IBR = Irrational Behavior Rate: fraction of decisions classified as physically impossible or inconsistent with the agent's own threat perception via posthoc PMT rules (for the analogous irrigation-domain metric, see BRI in Table 1; BRI ≈ 1 − IBR; see Methods). For Gemma-3 4B shown here, governance does not significantly reduce IBR (0.86% vs 1.15%); large IBR reductions occur for other models (Supplementary Table 1). Rule-based agent uses deterministic PMT threshold logic with parameterized agent heterogeneity. Post-relocation agent-years excluded.*

### The governance effect generalizes across water hazard types and model architectures

The governance mechanism that produces adaptive exploitation in chronic drought also generates higher behavioural diversity under acute flood hazard (Fig. 3). In the flood domain, 100 household agents made protective decisions (insurance, elevation, relocation, or inaction) over 10 years with stochastic flood events — a fundamentally different water context from continuous irrigation allocation. For the six-model comparison below, "governed" refers to agents with full governance validation and cognitively inspired memory (see Methods: Flood Domain Setup); for Gemma-3 4B, both memory configurations produced identical behavioural diversity (0.636 ± 0.044), confirming that the governance effect is attributable to the validator pipeline, not the memory subsystem. Governance reduced irrational behaviour rates for four of six models (p < 0.01), with directionally consistent reductions in all six (IBR = 0.1–1.7% governed versus 0.8–11.6% ungoverned; Supplementary Table 1). The largest reductions occurred in models exhibiting the highest ungoverned violation rates (Ministral 14B: 11.6% → 0.4%; Ministral 3B: 8.9% → 1.7%).

Six models spanning two families and three parameter scales (3.2B to 27B parameters) showed positive governance effects on behavioural diversity for five of six models, with three statistically significant (Fig. 4). The effect was strongest where ungoverned agents exhibited behavioural monoculture: Gemma-3 4B (Δ = +0.329) and Ministral 3B (+0.198). Three models produced non-significant effects: Gemma-3 12B (+0.027), Ministral 14B (+0.034), and Ministral 8B (−0.024), reflecting stronger baseline diversity at larger scales that left less room for governance to expand (see SI for model-specific discussion).

The consistency across two water domains — with positive effects in five of six models, three statistically significant, and near-complete elimination of irrational behaviour — provides converging evidence that institutional governance enables adaptive behavioural diversity. Because both domains use the same governance architecture with domain-specific rule configurations rather than redesigned decision logic, the framework addresses a longstanding limitation of agent-based water models: the need to rebuild decision modules for each application domain.
